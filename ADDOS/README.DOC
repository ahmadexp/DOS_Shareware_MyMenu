After Dark for DOS 1.0
September 16, 1993

Thank you for purchasing After Dark for DOS. 

For information about using After Dark, please consult your User's Manual
and the printed Addendum which come with After Dark for DOS.

-------------------------------------------------------
After Dark and TSR Programs:

After Dark runs a TSR, called ADTSR.EXE.  A TSR is a program that keeps
running, even after you start other application programs.  ADTSR is the 
program that makes your computer "go to sleep" after it hasn't been in
use, or after you've pressed the sleep hot key.  If you use other TSR
programs, such as network or mouse drivers, they MUST load before
ADTSR.  If you add new TSR programs to your system, make sure that they
appear before the ADTSR line of your Autoexec.bat file. You can experience
a crash if After Dark is not the last TSR to load.


After Dark for DOS Files:

The Installer will copy all of After Dark's files to a directory
of your choice.  The files are:

ADPANEL.EXE:  This is After Dark's Control Panel.  Run this program
to select your modules, demo them, and configure After Dark's features.

ADSETUP.EXE:  This is After Dark's Advanced Setup program.  
You will rarely use this program.   Run this program to configure 
After Dark to use your sound card.  You can also use ADSETUP to configure 
advanced features such as After Dark's memory usage, and After Dark's 
Inactive List.

ADTSR.EXE:  This is the memory-resident TSR program which lets After Dark
put your screen to sleep.  ADTSR is run every time your computer is started
up, through your computer's Autoexec.bat file.

ADRUN.EXE:  You won't need to run this program.  It runs the last selected
module.  When After Dark goes to sleep, it runs ADRUN.

AD_WRAP.EXE:  This program keeps people from accessing your computer by 
turning it off and back on again when After Dark's password protection
feature is in use.

CMOD.EXE:  This is a utility program used by After Dark.  

ADDOS.IMG:  If After Dark is unable to use EMS or XMS memory, it will
create a storage file called ADDOS.IMG.  

*.ADD:  All of After Dark's modules have the .ADD extension.

MISC:  There are a few other miscellaneous setting and configuration files.

AUTOEXEC.BAT File Modifications:

The After Dark for DOS Installation Program will make four modifications
to your Autoexec.bat file:

@AD_WRAP.EXE will be added as the first line of your Autoexec.bat file.
This is not a TSR program.  If you do not use After Dark's password protection
feature, you can remove this line from your Autoexec.bat file.

Your PATH statement will have After Dark for DOS' path added to it.  This
is not necessary for operation of After Dark.

SET ADPATH= is added to your Autoexec.bat file.  This command tells After 
Dark where its files are located.  This line MUST be in your Autoexec.bat
file, or After Dark will not work.

ADTSR will be added as the last line of your Autoexec.bat file.  This will
load After Dark's TSR program into memory, to give you screen saving
while running any DOS program.

Using After Dark for DOS and Windows:

After Dark for DOS will not conflict with Microsoft Windows in any way.
However, After Dark for DOS will not provide any screen saving while Windows
is running, even if your are running a DOS session under Windows.

For Microsoft Windows screen saving, we recommend After Dark for Windows.
After Dark for DOS and After Dark for Windows work together to provide
screen saving protection in both DOS and Windows.

If you need screen saving while running DOS sessions under Windows, you will
need to use AD-DOS.COM, which comes with After Dark for Windows.  AD-DOS.COM
will make After Dark for Windows come to the foreground after a time-out 
or hot key.  

The following batch file can be used to activate and deactivate AD-DOS.COM 
when you start and quit Windows. To use this batch file, copy it to a new 
file named WIN.BAT.  Put WIN.BAT into your WINDOWS directory.

             ******* Copy the text below  *******

@echo off
rem WIN.BAT by Berkeley Systems, Inc.
rem This file lets you have screen saving in DOS sessions under Windows
rem Place this file in your Windows directory.
rem If After Dark for DOS says it cannot be unloaded, don't worry.

rem This unloads After Dark for DOS, to save memory

rem This loads and/or enables the After Dark screen blanking TSR
