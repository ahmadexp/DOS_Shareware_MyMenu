The music is the property of Origin Systems and their respective songwriters.

These MIDI files were originally released on the Origin BBS in Jollyville.
Although acceptable, the General MIDI adaptation of these songs was pretty weak,
so I decided to arrange them for GS (Will work fine with General MIDI synths as
well).  Now they sound much more like the originals, but with the added depth
of GS effects.  (Be careful if you have strong bass output and the U6-INTRO.MID)
The songs themselves remain unchanged, only the instrument and GS effects have
been added.
Setup used to edit the songs:
 486/50 DX with a Roland SCC-1, Soundblaster AWE-32,
 Roland PC-200 MIDI keyboard, Vivid-3D Pro, and
 Cakewalk Professional for Windows 3.0.

 I have written several MIDI/GAME utilities (All freeware):
 Most can be found on large bulletin board systems and America On-Line:

 U8MT32   (Converts MIDI in Ultima 8 to MT32 format)
 PRIVMT32 (Converts MIDI in Privateer to MT32 format)
 MTTOGM12 (Converts MT-32 .MID files to General MIDI .MID Files)
 MT32GS12 (General MIDI emulation for the Roland MT-32/LAPC-1)
 next project (nearly complete): Interactive Music Player for System Shock
