Game: Stonekeep
Year: 1995
Composed by: Brian Luzietti
MIDI versions: GM, GS, AWE, FM
Platform: DOS

Additional info: There are four versions of each track, GM, GS, AWE and FM. They are, however, so similar and spread so erratically, that I can't tell which one is which. If someone can sort it out, it would help a lot.
