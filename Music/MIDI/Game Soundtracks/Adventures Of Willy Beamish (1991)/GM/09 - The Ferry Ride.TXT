                      (ROLAND SOUND CANVAS MIX)

System Requirements:

- MIDI File player capable of reading embedded SysEx data.
- General MIDI Sound Device  (Roland Sound Canvas recommended)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Dynamix's
"The Adventures of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  It has been converted
from the Roland MT-32 version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A
Roland Sound Canvas is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Converted for General MIDI by Tom Lewandowski.
