                   Enhanced for the SB32/AWE32/64

System Requirements:

- MIDI File player

This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Dynamix's "The Adventures
of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  It has been converted from the MT-32
version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Wave Table sound card is
strongly recommended.
