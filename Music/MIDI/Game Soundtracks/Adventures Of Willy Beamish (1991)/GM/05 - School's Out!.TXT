                         GENERAL MIDI VERSION



System Requirements:

- MIDI File player capable of reading Type 1 Standard MIDI file format and
   embedded System Exclusive data
- General MIDI Sound Card  (Roland Sound Canvas recommended)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Dynamix's "The Adventures
of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  It has been converted from the Roland
MT-32 version for playback on General MIDI sound cards.  A Roland Sound
Canvas is highly recommended for optimal playback.

Converted for General MIDI playback by Tom Lewandowski.
