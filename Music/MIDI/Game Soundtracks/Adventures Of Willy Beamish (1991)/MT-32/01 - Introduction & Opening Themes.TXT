                         -- NEW LONGER VERSION --



System Requirements:

- MIDI File player
- System Exclusive patch bank utility (i.e. MidiEx)
- Roland MT-32, CM-32L, CM-64, or LAPC-1
- MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface
   (Not required for LAPC-1 users.)


This Standard MIDI File (WB_1.MID) was recorded directly from Dynamix's
"The Adventures of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  In order to obtain the
proper sounds during playback, you must first transmit the included
WILLY.SYX SysEx patch bank file to the MT-32.  Use any SysEx utility (MidiEx,
Cakewalk, Quick Send, etc.) to transmit the patch bank to the MT-32
prior to playback of the song file.



Converted to Standard MIDI File format by Tom Lewandowski.
