                          -- NEW VERSION --



System Requirements:

- MIDI File player capable of reading Type 1 Standard MIDI File format
   and embedded System Exclusive data.
- Roland MT-32, MT-100, CM-32L, CM-64, or LAPC-I
- MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface
   (Not required for LAPC-I users.)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Dynamix's "The Adventures
of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  It contains embedded SysEx patch bank
data which will write new sounds to your MT-32.  Note that MIDI files which
contain embedded SysEx data are not compatible with all MIDI playback
programs.

Converted to Standard MIDI File format by Tom Lewandowski.
