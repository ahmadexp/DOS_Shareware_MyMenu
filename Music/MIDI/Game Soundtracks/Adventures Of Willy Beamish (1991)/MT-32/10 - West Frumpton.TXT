                         ROLAND MT-32 VERSION



System Requirements:

- MIDI File player capable of reading embedded SysEx data
- Roland MT-32, CM-32L, CM-64, or LAPC-1
- MPU-401 compatible MIDI interface
   (Not required for LAPC-1 users.)


This Standard MIDI File was recorded directly from Dynamix's "The Adventures
of Willy Beamish" adventure game.  It contains embedded System Exclusive data
which will write new sounds to your MT-32.  Note that MIDI files containing
embedded SysEx data are not compatible with all MIDI file players.
