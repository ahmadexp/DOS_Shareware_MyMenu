Game: Space Quest III: The Pirates of Pestulon
Year: 1989
Composed by: Bob Siebenberg
MIDI versions: GS, MT-32, GM

Additional info: Single file in the folder root is a complete soundtrack for Roland GS. In the MT-32 folder is MT-32 soundtrack. I've also included some single tracks for General MIDI. But GS plays fine practically everywhere.
