Game: Rex Blade: The Apocalypse
Year: 1996
Composed by: Dean Hudson
MIDI versions: GM

Additional info: For some reason, there are MIDI files in two formats, MID and XMI. Converted XMI files are exactly the same as MID files. However, there are more XMI files than MID files, so I converted the missing ones and included them here.
