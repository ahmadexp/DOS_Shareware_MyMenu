Game: Death Gate
Year: 1994
Composed by: Eric Heberling
MIDI versions: GM, FM, MT-32
Platform: DOS

Additional info: Original soundtrack is in XMI format. It consists of General MIDI, FM and MT-32 versions. General MIDI and MT-32 were converted without problems, but I'm not able to convert FM version, so I left it there just in the XMI format, which is playable in Winamp for instance.
