Game: Ultima VIII: Pagan
Year: 1994
Composed by: Nenad Vugrinec
MIDI versions: GM, FM
Platform: DOS

Additional info: First half of XMI files is made for General MIDI, second half is made for FM. Two last tracks are a bit odd, they sound like a beginning of the first track but damaged, so I put them in a separate folder.
