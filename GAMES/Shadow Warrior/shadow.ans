                             ³SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS³
                             ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

þ Shadow Warrior's minimum system requirements are:

  A Pentium with 16 megabytes of memory and VGA graphics.  A CD-ROM is required
  for the registered version.

  We strongly recommend a Pentium 90 with more than 16 megs of memory and PCI
  Local Bus Video (at least 2Mb of Video Memory), for optimal
  performance.

  For the SVGA modes, a VESA compliant video card is required.  Please see your
  video card's manual for info on how to find out if your card is VESA
  compliant.  If yours is not VESA compliant, you will need to use a software
  driver to provide this compliance.  We suggest a driver such as Display
  Doctor (formerly called UniVBE).  If you have the registered CD-ROM of Shadow
  Warrior, Display Doctor can be found on the CD-ROM in the \goodies\univbe
  directory. If you have the shareware version of Shadow Warrior, you must
  obtain Univbe on your own.  It can be obtained at any of 3D Realms' online
  support forums (See "3D Realms Online" at the bottom of this document for
  contact information).  It can also be obtained directly from the program's
  author (SciTech Software) at http://www.scitechsoft.com. To install Univbe,
  copy the files from the \goodies\univbe directory on the CD-ROM to a
  temporary directory on your hard drive, change to that directory, and type
  "INSTALL".

  NOTE: There are no versions of Shadow Warrior that have been optimized for
        any specific video cards, chipsets, or VR devices from 3D Realms. If
        such a version exists, it would have to have come from the people that
        make your particular card/device.  Please contact them.

þ For game play, the following devices are optionally supported: Keyboard,
  Mouse, Joystick, Gravis GamePad, Flightstick, & ThrustMaster/Wingman.

þ The following sound cards/devices are also optionally supported:

  For Music: Gravis UltraSound, Sound Blaster (all of them), SoundMan16,
             Pro Audio Spectrum, SoundScape, WaveBlaster, Sound Canvas,
             Adlib, and General MIDI.

  For SFX: Sound Blaster (all of them), Gravis UltraSound, SoundMan16,
           Pro Audio Spectrum, SoundScape, Disney/Tandy Sound Sources.

  There is no support for the PC Speaker.

Lo Wang.  Master ninja assassin for 20 years.  A shadow warrior.

Shadow warriors are the best of the best, and Lo Wang was the best of the
shadow warriors.  Every top company in Japan had a shadow warrior...a
protector, a negotiator, a cleaner.

Lo Wang worked for Zilla Enterprises, a conglomerate with control in every
major industry.  Too much control.  Power corrupts, and Master Zilla's
corporation was corrupted to the core.

Lo Wang discovered Master Zilla's demonic scheme to rule Japan, using creatures
summoned from the dark side.  A man of honor, Lo Wang quit.  But one as
powerful as Wang either must be on your side, or no one's side.  Master Zilla
unleashes his creations for their first test: to kill a single man, a shadow
warrior... Lo Wang.

This section will give you general guidelines on how to play Shadow Warrior.
Due to limitations of this document, pictures of the various objects and menus
cannot be provided.  If you have the registered version of Shadow Warrior,
please consult your manual for more detailed information, as well as for some
example pictures.


þ STARTING A NEW GAME

  To start a game of Shadow Warrior, you need to go to your Shadow Warrior game
  directory and type "SW" (without the quotation marks).  Once at the Main
  Menu, select "New Game" to start a game.  If you want to learn how to start a
  multi-player game, please see the section of this file titled, "How to Set Up
  & Play a Network (or Modem/Serial) Game".  Remember, you can press F7 right
  now to bring up the table of contents, which will let you jump to any part of
  this file.
  Once you've selected "New Game", you will be prompted for the name of the
  episode you wish to play.  Once you make your selection, you will be prompted
  to choose a difficulty level.  You can choose from four different difficulty
  levels:

  1) Tiny Grasshopper - The easiest mode.  Few enemies and lots of stuff.
  2) I Have No Fear   - Normal difficulty.
  3) Who Wants Wang   - The Default Setting.  For Experienced Players.
  4) No Pain No Gain  - For Experts Only.  Loads of enemies!

  Once you've made your selection, the game will load.

þ CONTROLLING LO WANG

  After you are in the game, you have many different keys that control Lo Wang.
  You can get a complete listing of the default keys by pressing the F1 key
  during gameplay.  Some of the basic controls used to play Shadow Warrior are:

  Arrows -> Move LoWang ³ Shift    -> Run      ³ 1 to 0 -> Weapons
  A      -> Jump        ³ CapsLock -> AutoRun  ³ Tab    -> Map
  Z      -> Duck        ³ Ctrl     -> Fire     ³ [ or ] -> Inventory Select
  Alt    -> Strafe      ³ Spacebar -> Open/Use ³ Enter  -> Use Inventory Item

  You can also look up and down by pressing Page Up or Page Down.  Using the
  Home and End keys aims up or down. You can use "U" to turn on a mouse aiming
  control system, and "I" to turn on crosshairs for aiming.

  There are more options than these:  press F1 during gameplay to see a
  complete listing of all default controls.  Any of these controls can be
  altered to whatever you want them to be by selecting the "Controller Setup"
  option in the setup program.  Please see the section on "Advanced Controller
  Setup for information regarding controlling your controller.

þ THE STATUS BAR

  During game play, the status bar at the bottom of the screen reveals plenty
  of info.  If you cannot see the status bar on your screen, please use the +
  and - keys to resize it (Press F1 in game for more info). Here is a
  description of all the items in the status bar, from left to right:

  HEALTH  - Shows Lo Wang's health level.  If this drops to zero, you're dead.
  ARMOR   - Shows the percentage of Lo Wang's armor that is left.
  WEAPONS - Shows the status of Lo Wang's weapons.  For each weapon, there are
            two numbers seperated by a /.  The first number is the amount of
            ammo you have for that weapon, and the second is the max amount of
            ammo possible for that weapon.  If the numbers are brightly lit,
            this means it is the currently selected weapon.  If it is of
            medium brightness, it means you have the weapon, but it is not
            currently selected.  If it is dark, it means you have not found
            that weapon yet.
  AMMO    - Shows the amount of ammo left for the currently selected weapon.
  INV     - Shows the percentage and status (if applicable) of the currently
            selected inventory item.  To change the currently selected item,
            use either the [ or ] key.
  KEYS    - Shows the keys currently in your possession.  Keys are required to
            unlock certain doors in the game.  For example, the red key will
            not open a yellow locked door, it will only open a red locked door.

þ LO WANG'S WEAPONS
  There are several weapons Lo Wang can have in his arsenal.  All of them
  will be listed here.  Pressing the number of the weapon (using the top row
  of your keyboard) during game play will activate that weapon, unless you
  don't have it or have run out of ammo for it.  Weapons 8 through 10 are only
  available in the registered version of Shadow Warrior.  Each of these weapons
  can be recharged with ammo found scattered around the levels.  Each weapon
  has its own type of ammo.  For example, if you find a Riot Gun ammo clip,
  you cannot use it with the Missile Launcher.

  1) Fist/Sword - These are the default weapons, and both share the same key,
     that being 1.   You can never run out of "ammo" for your fist or your
     sword, but they're nowhere near as effective as the other weapons in
     the game.  NOTE: There is a secret attack mode for the fists when
     used with a certain inventory item for stealth.

  2) Shuriken - Small hand held "stars" that you throw at enemies.
                Pick Up ammo, you get 9 shurikens, up to a max of 99
                You throw three at a time.
                You must have 3 or more in your possession to use.

  3) Riot Gun - Quad barrel shotgun.
                Picking up weapon gets you 8 shotshells; max of 52.
                Picking up ammo drum gets 24 shotshells
                Weapon has an autofire mode, press "3" again to alternate
                between autofire and standard mode.

  4) UZI Submachine Gun - Fast firing machine gun.
                          Picking up weapon gets you 50 bullets; max of 200
                          Picking up ammo clip gets you 50 bullets
                          If you pick up a second UZI, you can wield two
                          at the same time, John Woo style.

  5) Missile Launcher / Heat Seeker / Nuke
                        Picking up weapon gets 5 missiles; max of 50
                        Picking up ammo pack gets you 5 missiles.
                        This weapon has three modes, press "5" to alternate.
                        (See the "Heat Card" description in the REGULAR GAME
                        ITEMS section a few pages down for more info on this)
                        The third mode will activate the Nuke.  Don't be
                        near it when it goes off.

  6) Grenade Launcher:
                        Picking Up Weapon gets you 6 shells; max of 50
                        Picking up ammo box gets you 8 shells

  7) Sticky Bombs - Small bombs that stick to enemies, walls, you, and
                    many other objects in the environment!
                    Picking up a box of sticky bombs gives you 5 of them,
                    you can have a max of 20 at once.

               THERE ARE MORE WEAPONS IN THE REGISTERED VERSION!
            PLEASE CHECK YOUR REGISTERED GAME MANUAL FOR MORE INFO.

     NOTE: During a Multi-Player game, if you or your friends die, the dead
           player will sometimes drop their currently selected weapon.  If
           this weapon is picked up, all the ammo that was in that weapon will
           transferred to whomever picked it up.  The amount of ammo obtained
           from such a weapon pickup depends on how much ammo the player had
           when they were killed.

þ INVENTORY ITEMS

  There are several items that Lo Wang can find and use to help him during the
  game.  Unlike normal items, these are kept until you select and use them.
  Here is a list of the items, along with a brief description of each:

  1) Portable Medkit - A large white health pack.  This carries a maximum of
     100% of additional health.  When you are low on health, you can select
     this to bring your health back up to 100%.  The amount used to do this
     will be subtracted from the amount stored in the Medkit.  A shortcut to
     selecting and activating the Medkit is available by pressing the letter
     "M" during gameplay.

  2) Night Vision Goggles - When used, this makes enemies glow bright green.
     This is necessary to see some of the characters who you cannot normally
     see otherwise.  You can only have one of these at once, and has a gameplay
     shortcut by pressing the letter "N".

  3) Repair Kit - When used, you can repair one broken vehicle or other
     broken device you may encounter during game play.

  4) Caltrops - Small razor sharp talons of metallic death.  You throw
     the Caltrops on the floor, and they lie there.  If someone steps on them,
     they take some damage, and they will cry out in pain.  You can get 9
     caltrops to a box (3 uses).  Three Caltrops are thrown per use.

  5) Flash Bomb - Using this will blind nearby opponents and enemies for a
     few seconds; you can have up to two of these at once.

  6) Smoke Bomb - Using this will render you partially invisible for a few
     seconds; you can only have one of these at a time.

  7) Gas Grenade - Using this will cause the grenade to spray green noxious
     gas, damaging any opponent or enemy who gets too close (will hurt YOU
     as well).  You can only have one of these at a time.

þ REGULAR GAME ITEMS

  There are some other items that are not inventory items that Lo Wang will
  encounter during game play.  These items are used immediately when hit, and
  cannot be stored for later use like inventory items can.  They are:

  1) Fortune Cookie  - Gives you a +50 health boost, up to a maximum of 200.
  2) Small Medkit    - Gives you a +20 health boost, up to a max of 100.
  3) Nuclear Warhead - (Max 1) This counts as its own ammo, and no missiles are
                       required for use.
  4) Heat Seeker Card- This card will allow your next 5 missiles to heat
                       seek an opponent.
  5) Armor Vest      - (Gray) Takes your armor count to 50.
  6) Kevlar Armor    - (Red) Takes your armor count to 100.


þ GAME ENEMIES

  Here are the enemies that Lo Wang will encounter during the game:

  1) Evil Ninja     - (Brown) Fires an UZI or throws shurikens.
  2) Evil Ninja     - (Red) Fires UZI or missiles.
  3) Evil Ninja     - (Green/Invisible) Fires UZI or two different forms of
                      magical napalm.  Can flash bomb you, and is always
                      partially invisible until he dies.
  4) Coolie         - Walks around with a box of explosives.  If he gets near
                      you, he blows up, causing severe damage.
  5) Coolie Ghost   - Ghost of a Coolie. Sometimes rises from the remains of a
                      Coolie. Floats around, spitting magical balls. Can fade
                      in and out of visibility.
  6) Ripper         - Big ape-like monster. Jumps around, can cling to walls.
                      Will rip your heart out if you let him get too close.
  7) Hornet         - Flies around and stings the player.
  8) Accursed Heads,
     Bettie Mines   - Lies in wait for the player, then leaps out at the player
                      and generates various effects. They can spew caltrops,
                      spew poison gas, explode, launch grenades, or flash bomb
                      you.


þ CD-ROM CONTROL

Shadow Warrior has CD-ROM control in the game, which means you can listen to
your favourite audio CD if you wish.  To control these features, you need to
press the letter "T" during game play, which will bring up a place where you
can type in "commands" to the game (and cheat codes).  After you type in "T",
you can then enter any of these commands (which are listed here along with a
short description of what they do).

One other note: A CD audio cable must be connected to your sound card from
your CD Drive if you are going to hear the music.  Please check your CD and
your sound card documentation for more info on this.

cd on
   Re-enables the CD audio system after a "cd off" command.

cd off
   Shuts down the CD audio system.  No more music will be played unless it
   is re-enabled.

cd reset
   Causes the CD audio to re-initialize.  This is useful if you change CDs
   or insert the CD after you've already run Shadow Warrior.

cd play <track number>
   Plays the specified track one time.

cd loop <track number>
   Plays the specified track.  It will be repeated until either it is
   manually stopped or another track is started.

cd stop
   Stops the currently playing track.

cd resume
   Will resume playback of a stopped track.

cd eject
   This is for CD players that do not have a manual eject button.

cd remap <track1> <track2> <track3> ...
   Allows you to switch what tracks are played.  This is especially useful
   if you want to play music other than that on the SW CD.  If the CD
   audio system is told to play track 1, it will instead play the 1st
   track you specified.  For example: assuming a CD with 1 data track and
   8 music tracks, the command "cd remap 1 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2" would leave
   the data alone and play the audio tracks as if they had been placed on
   the CD in the opposite order.

cd info
   Reports information such as the number and types of tracks on the current
   CD, what track (if any) is currently playing, and the playback volume.

                          ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

If you want to play a network, modem, or serial game, you must use the
SETUP.EXE program found in your game's directory.  You also need to run the
setup program to configure your sound card, controller, and video mode.
Here is a brief summary of the options available in the Shadow Warrior setup
program:

þ SOUND SETUP

  This option will let you configure your sound and music options.  Use this
  to tell the game which sound card and music card your computer has.

  If you are using the registered version, there are no music setup controls.
  This is because the registered version uses CD audio only.

þ SCREEN SETUP

  This option will let you pick which video mode you wish to play in.  The
  SVGA options require the use of a VESA compliant video card.  Check your
  video card's manual for info on whether your card is VESA compliant.

þ CONTROLLER SETUP

  This option will let you choose what controller(s) you wish to play with,
  and will allow you to customize the controls for them.  If you wish to alter
  the controller layout, this is the place to do it.  Please see the next
  section, "Advanced Controller Setup" for information on some of the more
  advanced uses of this section.

þ NETWORK GAME

  This option will let you configure and play a network game of Shadow Warrior.
  Please see the section on "How to Set Up & Play a Network Game" for detailed
  information on this.  Press F7 now to see an index of sections.

þ MODEM GAME

  This option will let you configure and play a modem game of Shadow Warrior.
  Please see the section on "How to Set Up & Play a Modem Game" for detailed
  information on this.  Press F7 now to see an index of sections.

þ SERIAL GAME

  This option will let you configure and play a serial game of Shadow Warrior.
  Please see the section on "How to Set Up & Play a Serial Game" for detailed
  information on this.  Press F7 now to see an index of sections.

þ SEE THE SHADOW WARRIOR HELP FILE

  This option will let you see the file you are currently viewing.

þ USER LEVEL SELECTION (REGISTERED VERSION ONLY)

  If you are using the registered version, you can select user created files
  here.  The setup program will only recognize about 400 user levels, if you
  have more than this (yikes!), then you should use some alternate method of
  maintaining your user file database.

þ CHANGE SETUP FILENAME

  This option will let you alter the name of the configuration file you are
  working on.  With this option, you can have multiple configurations per game.
  This way, if a friend comes and plays on your machine, he can have his own
  keyboard (or anything else) layout, and it won't upset your configuration.

þ SAVE AND LAUNCH SHADOW WARRIOR

  This will save your configuration file and launch Shadow Warrior in single
  player mode. Do not use this option if you wish to play a multi-player game.


                           ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                           ³ADVANCED CONTROLLER SETUP³
                           ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


  Keyboard and FlightStick: (compatible with Microsoft SideWinder Joystick)
  Keyboard and ThrustMaster: (compatible with Logitech Wingman)
  Keyboard and GamePad: native support for the Gravis GamePad

The support of these new joysticks means that the hat switch is supported on
those joysticks possessing one, and that rudder support has been added for
people owning an external rudder.  The GamePad no longer functions as an analog
joystick but rather as a digital one.  A special setup menu has been created
just for the purpose of setting up the GamePad.  For all other joysticks, the
"Setup Joystick" menu should still be consulted for changing joystick options.
Enabling the rudder can be done under the Setup Joystick menu as well.

The second major improvement involves the menu known as advanced control
options.  Advanced control options allows you to redefine a controller
completely.  This is accomplished through redefinable analog axes and being
able to assign buttons to digitized axes as well. An analog device is one which
returns proportional values based on the speed or extent to which the device is
manipulated.  Examples of analog devices are mice and most joysticks.  A
digital device is one which returns on or off values when it is manipulated.
Examples of digital devices are the keyboard and the gamepad. The new control
system takes an analog input (such as the mouse or joystick) and digitizes it
into an on or off.  Once this is done, it is possible to assign a button to the
newly digitized input.  For example, suppose the mouse was setup in such a way
that when it was moved up it translated into pressing the fire button and when
it was moved down it translated into pressing the open button. This would
probably not be an advantageous setup, but it demonstrates how an axis can have
buttons assigned to it. At the same time, however it would be possible to still
use the analog component of that axis to move the player forward and backward.
In essence the player would always fire when moving forward and try to open
things when moving backward.  The advanced control options menu is broken up
into advanced mouse setup, advanced joystick setup, and advanced throttle /
rudder setup. Each these sub-menus allow you to define the control parameters
for two axes.  The mouse and joystick each have two axes, X and Y, and the
throttle/rudder compromise a third set of X and Y axes. For each of these axes
one can assign an analog function (either turning, strafing or moving) and
optional digital ones.

One should keep in mind that both analog and digital control options are active
at the same time, so in most situations if you want to use an axes as an analog
one, it should not be used a digital one as well.  When you first enter this
menu, you will see how the axes are defined by default.  If you change any of
the axes definitions, the only way to restore the default definitions is by
deleting your setup file and starting over.

Therefore, it is recommended that you understand how the system works before
changing these advanced options.

There is a new option located in the Setup Mouse menu, called "Mouse Aiming".
When Mouse aiming is on, moving the mouse forward and backward pitches the
player's head up and down.  Setup allows one to change the way in which the
mode is activated.  The Mouse Aiming buttons is defaulted to be a toggle button
meaning, that it must be pressed once to enter the "Mouse Aiming," and then
pressed again to leave the mode.  If mouse aiming mode is set to momentary
instead of togglable, "Mouse Aiming" is only active as long as the Mouse Aiming
button is depressed.

         Before contacting Technical Support, please try all of the things
  listed in this file first!  If you do contact us, please do not do so unless
   you provide the information requested at the bottom of this document.  We
      cannot help if you do not provide us with the information requested.

þ 3D Realms strongly recommends that you consult your hardware and software
  manuals for your system before you make any suggested changes to your current
  system setup.  Your manuals will tell you if you are about to make changes
  that may irreparably alter your computer or its configuration. Modifying your
  system or software can be dangerous if not done properly. 3D Realms will not
  be able to assist you with any problems resulting from such modifications.

þ If you get an error that has the words "Granular Limit Error" in it, you'll
  have to try booting clean.  Info on "booting clean" is elsewhere in this
  document. The only other thing it could be is some sort of configuration
  setting in your BIOS, but unfortunately, we cannot recommend ideas for this,
  as Granular Limit error is an extremely common problem.

  The only other solution would be if you have a Ensoniq sound card.  If you
  do, and get Granular Limit errors, it usually means that your sound card
  drivers are not correctly installed.

þ If you get random lockups, look at the contents of your config.sys file.
  Look and see if a line similar to this appears: "device=emm386.exe noems".
  If the noems appears, remove it.  Also, if you are using an alternate
  memory manager such as QEMM, make sure it is providing EMS services.

þ If you have a NexGen/586 CPU/Motherboard, you most likely can't get the game
  running.  Try going into your CMOS and look for a setting called "Alternate
  Instructions".  If it is set to OFF, set it to ON. If this doesn't work,
  NexGen has a fix on their World Wide Web site called the Q87 floating point
  emulator.  Their Web site can be reached at http://www.nexgen.com.

þ If you get the error "Exec Error: No such file or directory", it's likely you
  have selected the controller configuration "Keyboard and External".  Go back
  and reconfigure your controller.  Do not select the "External" controller
  unless you have a controller or a device that specifically tells you that you
  need to select this.

þ If you are using the Build editor that comes with the registered CD-ROM, and
  you cannot correctly use the 3D mode, make sure to copy the contents of the
  \goodies\build directory to the directory you have Shadow Warrior installed
  to.  Build cannot be run from a different directory than the game itself.

  Also, when you copy the files, DO NOT USE WINDOWS TO COPY THEM.  Doing so
  will make the resultant copy read-only, and this will cause further problems.
  MAKE SURE THAT YOU COPY THE FILES MANUALLY YOURSELF IN MS-DOS.  Make sure
  that your Build files are not marked read only.  This will cause problems.

þ If you run the game, and get an error that says "Cache Size of zero", or get
  an error that three zeros in it, you most likely have a bad/altered/corrupt
  SW.GRP file.  Check the size of the file on your HD vs the one in the
  \swinst directory on the CD-ROM.  If it is incorrect, MANUALLY COPY THE
  FILE yourself in DOS (do not use Windows).

þ Help!  My directories are gone after playing Shadow Warrior! Check your DOS
  environment. Type "SET" at the command line, and if it looks abnormal,
  reboot. Specifically, you're looking for the DOS environment variable
  DIRCMD. Try entering "SET DIRCMD=", and all should be OK.

þ If you get a message saying "Invalid OpCode", it means you are most likely
  running the game on a 386 computer.  It will not be possible to get around
  this, Shadow Warrior was not designed to run on 386 or 486 computers.  Our
  listed minimum for Shadow Warrior is a Pentium.

þ If you are playing the game, and cannot get the RTS sounds to work, you need
  to make sure you haven't turned "Kid Mode" on.  If Kid Mode is on, the RTS
  system will not work.

  If you bought your version at Walmart, then you most likely have the
  restricted version.  Walmart will only sell a version that has parental lock
  forced on.  To get around this, contact GT Interactive at
  http://www.gtgames.com; they distribute a patch to correct this.

þ If you notice the game running slowly on your system, here are a few
  suggestions on improving game performance.

  ¯ Enable your disk cache.  Before playing Shadow Warrior, enter "SMARTDRV
    4000".  This should speed up access.

  ¯ Disable your upper memory manager (QEMM, Qualitas Max 8, EMM386, etc).
    Since Shadow Warrior is a protected mode game, the services of these
    programs are not needed.

  ¯ Try reducing the screen size.  When playing the game, you can press either
    '-' to reduce your screen size, or '+' to increase it.

  ¯ Try reducing the amount of digital channels that you have set for sound
    effects.  Some system configurations have problems with having Shadow
    Warrior set for higher than 4 digital channels.

  ¯ Try reducing the mixing selection on your sound card from 16 bit to 8 bit.
    This is done from the SETUP.EXE program, under the "SETUP SOUND FX" menu
    item.  8 Bit Mono is the fastest music/sound combination there is in Shadow
    Warrior, so if you have slowdown problems, try selecting 8 Bit Mono.

  ¯ Use Scitech's Display Doctor.  See elsewhere in this document for info on
    how to obtain/install/use this program.

  ¯ Upgrade your video card.  Shadow Warrior runs very slow on older, ISA only
    video machines.  There's nothing that can be done about this, these old
    video cards are too slow.  The game really needs Local Bus Video to run
    smoothly, preferably PCI local bus video.


þ If you are playing with a MicroSoft Natural Keyboard, (or some other Windows
  95 compatible keyboard that has the new "Windows Logo" keys) and hit them
  during game play, you will note that your game will be interrupted and
  control of your computer will go to Windows.  These keys can be disabled via
  the use of a program that MicroSoft puts out called "DOSWINKY".  It is
  available on MicroSoft's Kernel Toys Home Page, which is reachable at:
  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/krnltoy.htm   This is also included
  on the registered CD-ROM of this game in the \goodies\doswinky directory.
  PLEASE DO NOT ASK US FOR HELP WITH THIS.  CONTACT MICROSOFT.

þ To get the MicroSoft Sidewinder Pro 3D joystick working with Shadow Warrior,
  you'll need to do these two things.

  1) Move the switch on the bottom of the controller to "One".
  2) Pick Flightstick as your controller in the Shadow Warrior setup program.

þ Help! I can't get my MicroSoft Sidewinder Pro GamePad to work!

  To our knowledge, there is no way to get this controller working with Shadow
  Warrior. The reason for this is that this device will only work in Windows95.
  This controller will not work in a pure DOS boot, which is the recommended
  way to play the game. This controller will work in a Win95 DOS Box, however,
  but we do not support that.

þ If you are using a joystick and your performance seems erratic, make sure to
  calibrate the joystick inside the setup program.  Also, check and make sure
  that the joystick port you are using is speed adjustable.  If it is, then try
  tinkering with the speed.  Check your port's manual for more info.

  Please note that most game ports that are built into sound cards, I/O cards,
  or motherboards are not speed adjustable.  Unless your port comes with
  software that allows you to calibrate your port's speed, you can assume that
  the port is not speed adjustable.

  If your system does not have a speed adjustable game port, your only solution
  may be to purchase one.  The reason for this is that most newer systems run
  at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than your port can send
  data.  In short, your system is outrunning your game port, and Shadow Warrior
  can't see what the port is sending since it doesn't come in fast enough.
  Fortunately, speed adjustable ports such as the Gravis Eliminator or JDR
  Microdevices' MCT Micro-III are inexpensive solutions to this problem. (Note:
  3D Realms does not endorse any of these products - they are listed here only
  as examples of what is available.)
  Finally, make sure you do not have more than one active joystick port on your
  machine at any time unless you have a special game port card that has two
  ports built onto it.  Two game ports cannot be active on two different cards,
  since they use the same hardware address.  You must disable one port if your
  system has two ports on two different cards.

þ If you are having problems getting your joystick to function, you will need
  to select it in the setup menu. Once in the control menu select CHOOSE
  CONTROLLER TYPE and press enter.

  Please select Keyboard & FlightStick.

  Then save and launch Shadow Warrior. When starting up it will ask you to
  calibrate. If it did not you did not select the FlightStick as your
  Controller.

þ If you can't get your mouse working, first make sure you have selected
  "Keyboard & Mouse" as your controller in the Shadow Warrior setup program.
  If that doesn't work, you'll need to first you will need to make sure that
  you are completely out of windows. For Windows 3.11 and lower just exit to
  dos. For Windows 95 you will need to select these buttons: <Start> <Shutdown>
  <Restart the computer in MS-DOS mode>

  Then from the dos prompt you will need to make sure that your mouse driver is
  loaded. To do this you type in MOUSE at the dos prompt. It should come back
  with Mouse Driver now Loaded.  If it does not, you will need to locate where
  on your hard drive your DOS BASED MOUSE DRIVER is loaded, and run it.


þ This game supports the VESA VBE standard for SuperVGA graphics.  Many Super
  VGA graphics cards are VESA VBE compatible at the hardware level, requiring
  no special action on your part to get the game running correctly.   If you
  are having problems running this game with the graphics card in your
  computer, try the following steps:

  1) If you have the VESA VBE driver that came with your graphics card, then
     install the driver and try to run the game.  Most VESA VBE drivers can be
     installed from a program that you run at the DOS command line.  Consult
     the documentation that came with your graphics card or computer system for
     installation instructions and VESA VBE compatibility.

  2) If you cannot find a VESA VBE driver for your graphics card, call your
     graphics card or system manufacturer or dial up their BBS, CompuServe
     forum, or Internet site.  You will most likely be able to download a
     driver or have them send you one by mail.

  3) If you do not have a VESA VBE driver for your graphics card or your VESA
     VBE driver does not work with the game, then try the Universal VBE driver,
     Display Doctor (formerly UniVBE).  Display Doctor is included with the
     registered CD-ROM of Shadow Warrior, and can be found in the directory
     \goodies\univbe on the CD.  Please note that while we have included
     Display Doctor for your convenience on the CD, it is a shareware product
     produced by a different company.  If it works for this game and solves
     compatibility problems for you, then you may want to continue using it for
     this and other games.  If you continue to use it, you should register the
     program.  To register Display Doctor, follow the instructions onscreen
     during the Display Doctor installation procedure.

     To install Display Doctor, go to the \goodies\univbe directory on the
     Shadow Warrior CD-ROM, and type install.  Installation instructions are on
     screen. If you are having problems installing Display Doctor, please
     contact Scitech. UniVBE is not a 3D Realms or Apogee program, we cannot
     help with it.

þ If you have an ATI Mach64 video card and cannot access the higher SVGA modes,
  check your C:\MACH64 directory for the file m64vbe.com.  Run it before you
  play Shadow Warrior, and you should be OK.  If you do not have this file,
  contact ATI for an update.

þ If you have a Matrox Millenium video card and cannot get your video working
  properly, please make sure the BIOS on your video card is at least v2.0.  If
  it is not, contact Matrox for a BIOS upgrade.  Please also note that there is
  a problem with this video card and running at the 800x600 resolution. The
  game should play right, but trying to save a game will usually cause the game
  to crash.  We have no idea why this is happening.  All we can say is to not
  play in 800x600.  At the time of the writing of this file, the current BIOS
  version is v2.5.

þ If you have a Diamond SpeedStar video card, disable Zero Wait State.

þ If you are running a Compaq computer with a VGA card and the game tells you
  that you do not have a VGA card, or if you experience lockups on a Compaq
  computer with a VGA card, you will need to contact Compaq for a special video
  driver.  The reason for this is that Compaq has some video cards that do not
  conform to all proper detection methods.  There is a device driver available
  from Compaq that will fix this problem.  The driver's name is FINDVGA.SYS.
  This file used to be available on their BBS with the filename of SP0117.ZIP,
  but as of the writing of this document, it is not available.  Please contact
  Compaq if you cannot locate the file.


þ I have the registered version, and I'm not hearing any of the CD-Audio.

  a) Make sure your Shadow Warrior CD is in the drive.
  b) Make sure your CD-ROM drive is active, and all drivers are loaded.
  c) Make sure that your CD Audio cable is correctly installed and hooked
     up to your sound card.  Please see the manuals for your sound card and
     CD-ROM drive for more information on this.

þ If you have a Creative Labs Sound Blaster 16 and some sort of daughterboard
  add-on card like the WaveBlaster or Roland Sound Canvas daughterboard, you
  may have trouble getting the MIDI music and SFX working properly.  To fix
  this, first try selecting WaveBlaster as your music device, even if you don't
  actually have a true WaveBlaster.  If this doesn't solve the problem, make
  sure you are picking 8bit 11Khz sound in the Shadow Warrior setup program.
  Picking values higher than this can sometimes cause problems.

þ If you are playing the game, and have General MIDI selected as your music
  card, or have one of the more advanced Sound Blaster cards (AWE32, AWE64),
  and experience "pauses" during game play, make sure you are picking 8bit
  11Khz sound in the Shadow Warrior setup program.  Selecting higher than
  this will cause problems.

þ If you hear static when you are playing with a Sound Blaster or compatible
  card, make sure to turn the MIC and LINE volumes to zero. Your card may be
  seeing input from these, resulting in static.  For a Sound Blaster Pro, the
  program that adjusts these is called SBP-SET:  see your card's manual for
  precise instructions on how to do this.  If you still continue to hear static
  after doing this, try disconnecting any parallel port devices.  IRQ5 and
  IRQ7, which are used by sound cards, are often frequently used by printers as
  well.  If you have both plugged in, the result may be static and poor sound
  performance.

þ If you have an AWE32 PnP card, you should read this if you play in Windows95.
  AWE32 PnP cards can have different base addresses in DOS and in Windows95.
  Check your System Properties in Windows95 to see what base address Windows95
  thinks your sound card is set at and use that in the Shadow Warrior Setup.
  If you're running from DOS, use whatever base address you find in the
  BLASTER variable (this means PURE dos, not a Win95 DOS Box). Sometimes the
  music test will work with the incorrect base address, but the game will not.
  NOTE: The worst part of this is that since setup defaults to your BLASTER
  settings, the default setup might not always work under Windows95.

þ If you have an AWE32 and are having problems initializing the sound, check
  the SET BLASTER line.  Make sure that E620 is in there.  Check the section on
  "WHAT IS THE SET BLASTER COMMAND.." in this document for more information.

þ If you have an AWE32 Sound Card and get an "MPU-401 Initialization Error"
  message, you will need to turn your computer totally OFF, wait about 5-10
  seconds, and then turn it back on again.  Delete the SW.CFG file from your
  game's directory, then run the SETUP.EXE program again and try reselecting
  your music/sfx.  This error is caused by picking incorrect settings:  if you
  pick the wrong settings for an AWE32, you need to power down and retry, not
  just reboot.

þ If it seems like sounds that should be coming out of your left speaker are
  instead coming out of your right speaker (or vice-versa), you can fix this in
  the sound menus of the SETUP.EXE program.  Go to the Main Shadow Warrior
  menu, choose the options menu, and then the sounds menu.  From there, you can
  toggle the "Flip Stereo" option on or off.  This should correct the problem.

þ If you are getting an error that says "Cannot play due to an invalid or
  conflicting IRQ", please see the following paragraph.

þ If you have a Sound Blaster (or a Sound Blaster clone) card and you are not
  getting sound effects, you most likely have your sound card configured
  incorrectly.  Most clone cards' setup programs do not properly set up a SET
  BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file, or do not set it up at all.  This is
  also the case with some new systems that have sound cards already installed.
  The SET BLASTER command is used by the game's sound engine to determine where
  to send sound events for Sound Blaster and compatible cards. If this command
  is incorrect or missing, you will either not hear sounds or will experience
  sound distortion.  To correct this, please read the section of this file
  titled "What is the 'SET BLASTER' Command?" (Press F7 right now to see a list
  of sections).  Also, please consult your sound card's manual for information
  regarding Sound Blaster Emulation to find out what port address (or "base
  address"), IRQ, and DMA channel is being used by your card for Sound Blaster
  Emulation.  This information will be needed in order for you to follow the
  instructions in the "SET BLASTER" section of this document.

  This problem sometimes also affects people with true Sound Blaster cards,
  especially if you are running Windows 95 and are using the Win95 drivers. If
  you are running Windows 95 and don't have any sounds when playing in MS-DOS
  Mode, you probably do not have DOS-based Sound Blaster drivers loaded. Please
  check your sound card's manual for info on loading DOS-based drivers for your
  card.

  If your card does not have information concerning the SET BLASTER command (or
  loading DOS-based drivers) in its manual, or if your system or card did not
  come with a sound card manual, please contact the company that made your
  card or system (or the place you purchased the card or system from) before
  calling 3D Realms Technical Support.  Since sound cards differ so much
  from brand to brand (and sometimes even within the same brand and model), we
  cannot provide detailed assistance for every sound card on the market.  Your
  card or system manufacturer (or dealer) can usually provide much faster help
  for basic sound card problems than 3D Realms' Technical Support can.

  Here are a few more things you can try to get your sound card going:

  1) Check your sound card's manual on Sound Blaster emulation.  There may be
     some driver that you are not loading, or some switch you are not properly
     setting.  This is especially true for Plug And Play cards when you are
     running in DOS mode on a Win95 machine.

  2) Load up your sw.cfg file (or the one you're using) into an ASCII text
     editor, and look for the line "BlasterDMA16=5".  Change it to read
     "BlasterDMA16=1", it may make a difference.

  3) Check and make sure that you have the most up to date drivers for your
     sound card.

þ If you have a Gravis UltraSound and you are not getting sound effects, or if
  your GUS sound effects are scratchy or distorted, make sure your GF1 IRQ is
  set to 7 or lower.  This is controlled by the SET ULTRASND= command in your
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  A sample of this command line would be:

                        SET ULTRASND=220,1,1,7,5

  The next to last digit on this line (the 7, in this example) is your GF1 IRQ.
  This number must be 7 or less for Shadow Warrior to operate properly.  If it
  is higher than 7, you will need to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT and change it to 7
  or lower.  Save the change, exit your editor, and reboot so that the change
  will take effect.

  Please note that this is not a limitation of the sound engine used by Shadow
  Warrior.  Rather, it is a performance limitation imposed by the current
  generation of DOS extender technology, including the DOS/4GW extender used to
  create this game.  In almost every case, support for interrupts higher than 7
  would result in an unacceptable slowdown of the game.

þ If you are using an Ensoniq Soundscape, and can't get sound, you need to make
  sure your DOS based sound drivers from Ensoniq are loaded.  If they are not,
  please install them, and make sure they are loaded.  You should also check
  that the following lines appear (IN THIS ORDER) in your autoexec.bat file:

  SET BLASTER=A220 Ixx Dx T1
  SET SNDSCAPE=C:\SNDSCAPE (or the directory your drivers are installed in)
  C:\SNDSCAPE\SSINIT.EXE /I (or the directory your drivers are installed in)

  In addition, the directory in the second line also must have a correctly
  configured SNDSCAPE.INI file in it.  Please consult the Ensoniq documentation
  for more info on this.

  If this doesn't work, go to Ensoniq's web site and update your sound card
  drivers.  This can be done by going to http://www.ensoniq.com, and then
  picking these options:

  1) Download
  2) Multimedia Drivers
  3) Choose Operating System
  4) Follow the rest of the on screen instructions from Ensoniq.

  This document was written on August 15th, 1997.  It's possible that Ensoniq
  may have rearranged their web contents when you read this.  If you can't
  find this info, contact their webmaster.

þ If you have a Packard Bell computer and are using their combo modem/sound
  card but can't get any sound, try this.  In your c:\sound144\utility
  directory there should be a program called setmode.exe.  Change to this
  directory, and type "setmode /sbp".  This will tell the card to operate in
  Sound Blaster Pro mode.  If it is operating in Windows Sound System mode, you
  will NOT get any sounds, because the Windows Sound System is not supported.
  If this doesn't work, go back into the Shadow Warrior setup program, and
  reselect your sound card, and make sure you pick "SOUND BLASTER (plain)", and
  select 8 Bit 11Khz MONO sound.

þ If you are simply not getting sound or bad sound, or Lo Wang is speaking
  too fast or too slow, check and make sure your sound drivers (preferably
  DOS based) are installed correctly.  After that, check and make sure that
  your SET BLASTER line is truly set for what your sound card settings are
  configured to at game runtime. (Check the help file for this game for
  info on how to do that).

  If this doesn't work, or even if it does, go into the Shadow Warrior setup
  program, and reselect your sound card (making sure you pick "SOUND BLASTER
  (plain)", and select 8bit 11Khz MONO 4 Voice Sound.

  You may also wish to check and see if your card really is Sound Blaster
  Compatible.  Not all cards are as compatible as they like to think they are.
  If your sound card is set at (or hard coded to) IRQ9, pick IRQ2 in the
  Shadow Warrior setup program.  IRQ's 9 & 2 are generally interchangeable.

  "Failure to detect FM Chip" means that your sound drivers are either not
  present, are incorrectly installed, or are not matching what your sound
  card really is set at (either in native mode, or in Sound Blaster
  Emulation Mode).

( None of this will work if your card is not Sound Blaster compatible.
  Truly compatible - a lot of cards that say they are really aren't. )


þ If you are playing a network game, and get an error that reads something
  like "General Failure reading Drive ..." it probably means you're trying to
  play the game from a single shared copy on the network.  You can't do this,
  you need to have the game installed on each local computer that wishes to
  play the game.  Playing from a shared copy is not possible.

  Additionally, it is not legal to install a single registered CD-ROM to more
  than one machine.  Each copy playing must have it's own registered copy of
  the game.  Please read the license.doc on the SW CD for more information.

þ Shadow Warrior sends more packets per second than Duke Nukem 3D did.  This
  means that while you can play at 9600bps, *MUCH* better performance would be
  had if you played at 14400 (or 19200 - remember everyone has to have the same
  port speed).  Also, Shadow Warrior is more easily affected by net lag than
  Duke Nukem 3D was.  This means that if there is a lot of traffic and file
  copying going on on your network, it can throw the game out of sync.

þ If you are having modem and/or serial problems (they're solved the same way)
  then read this. Followed correctly, this information will solve the vast bulk
  of modem problems out there.

  Make sure:

  1) Both sides are using default, unmodified CON files.
  2) Both sides have port speeds of 19200.
  3) Both sides have 16550 serial ports.  You will always have problems if you
     only have an 8250 or a 16450.

  4) Also, make sure to manually enter the port settings and IRQ into the
     Shadow Warrior setup program.   Don't let it use "default".

  5) If this doesn't work, try repeating these steps, but putting the port
     speed at 19200 for both sides.

  6) That all players have the same version of the game.  If, for example, you
     have Shadow Warrior v1.2, and your friend has v1.1, then you will not be
     able to play; all players MUST have the same version.

þ If you cannot get your modem recognized by Shadow Warrior, and you have a
  "Winmodem" or "Plug 'N' Play" modem (the former is almost always the latter),
  then read this:

  If you are having problems using your Plug & Play Modem in DOS with our
  Shadow Warrior (or any other of our modem games), the problem is this.  Plug
  & Play modems were designed for environments (ex: Windows95) where the
  environment does the initializing of the card.

  The problem here is that if you are playing in MS-DOS mode, and bypassing the
  Win95 GUI, your card is never being initialized, and as such, there's nothing
  for our game to find.

  What you will need to do is to find some way of initializing your PnP modem
  in DOS.  Info on this would be in the manual for the modem that you have.
  Quite often modems with the brand name of "Winmodem" fall under this
  category, too.

  Also, when you DO get the card configured in MS-DOS, make sure to take note
  of the port address and IRQ number as well as the port number that the card
  is initialized with.   These WILL BE IMPORTANT when you setup the Shadow
  Warrior game.

  VERY IMPORTANT!!!: If your modem is at IRQ 9 or higher, it may not be
  possible to get it working.  You need to be using an IRQ of 7 or less (due to
  limitations of the Dos Extender).

  Once you have all this info from a properly initted PnP modem, go into the
  Shadow Warrior setup program, and:

  0) DO NOT PICK DEFAULT FOR ANY OF THESE.  ENTER INFO!
  1) Select Modem Game
  2) Select "Setup COM Port"
  3) Select "Change Com Port" (If Necessary).  Enter the Com port Number here.
  4) Select "Change IRQ" (If Necessary).  Enter the Com Port's IRQ # here.
  5) Select "Change UART" (If Necessary).  *THIS IS NOT 8250 or 16550*.  This
     is the hex address where your port resides at.  For example, a value to
     put here would be 02e8.
  6) Put the port speed at 9600.
  7) If this doesn't work, repeat these steps, putting the port speed at 19200
     on both sides.

(This info is also useful if you don't have a PnP modem and are having problems
with your modem not being recognized.)

  We strongly urge you NOT TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT MODEM INIT STRINGS UNLESS YOU
  ARE SURE THE CHANGED SETTINGS WILL WORK.  Changing them tends to cause
  problems, and you should only change them if the defaults do not work.


þ If you see the error message "IPX & NetBIOS not detected", it means that you
  are trying to run a network game of Shadow Warrior without loading your
  network drivers.  If this error occurs, consult the manual for your network
  on how to load these drivers.  3D Realms cannot help with the setup and use
  of your network.


þ If you get an error message that says, "Not enough memory to run Shadow
  Warrior" or "Shadow Warrior requires 9Mb free to execute", you need to make
  more memory available.  The DOS MEM command should report 9,000K (or 9.0
  megs) total memory free.", it means that you do not have enough free total
  memory to run the game.  This is almost always caused by having such things
  as memory managers (QEMM/EMM386), disk caches (SMARTDRV, Norton Cache), and
  other programs loaded into memory.  These programs are usually loaded when
  your system is first powered up (otherwise known as when you "boot" your
  system).

  The best way around this is to "BOOT CLEAN."  This means to boot your system
  without loading any unnecessary memory resident programs.  The easiest way
  to do this is to create a bootable floppy disk according to the instructions
  in your DOS manual (see the FORMAT /S command) and create a file called
  CONFIG.SYS and a file called AUTOEXEC.BAT on that disk.  Please refer to
  your DOS manual for instructions on creating these files.

  These files should contain the following lines:

   CONFIG.SYS
   ==========
   FILES=30
   BUFFERS=30
   STACKS=9,256
   <if your sound card requires a line in config.sys, put it here>
   <if you use disk compression, make sure to load that driver>
   <if you require a driver to access your hard drive, make sure to use it>

   AUTOEXEC.BAT
   ============
   @echo off
   <your path line>
   <your prompt line>
   <if your sound card requires a line in autoexec.bat, put it here>
   MOUSE <if you play with a mouse>
   SET BLASTER=<see section on SET BLASTER for more help on this line>

  The <your path line> and <your prompt line> items in the sample
  AUTOEXEC.BAT file refer to the lines that start with the words PATH and
  PROMPT in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file that is on your C: drive.  These lines
  are optional, but including them will make navigating your hard drive a
  little easier.

  If you are running Windows 95, you will need to to press the F8 key when you
  see the "Starting Windows 95" message, and then pick the option that says
  "Command Prompt Only".  This will prevent you from going into the GUI
  (desktop) portion of Windows 95.  Windows 95 is still capable of having
  multiple boot configurations, and we strongly urge you to create one.
  Please note that if you do this, you may not have access to your sound card
  or mouse when in DOS.  If so, you will need to load DOS-based drivers for
  your sound card or mouse.  Please check the respective manuals for your
  sound card and mouse for info on how to load drivers for them in DOS.

  3D Realms has set up a section on our web site for multi-boot configurations
  in Windows95.  This is our recommended way of playing with Windows.  Please
  see http://www.3drealms.com/tech/multiboot.html for more information.

  If you have DOS 5, you will need to create a boot disk and make
  CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files, using the above examples.  If you have
  DOS 6 or higher, you have two ways of booting clean without the need for
  a boot disk.

  For DOS 6 and higher, the fastest way is to reboot your computer and
  watch for a message that says "Starting MS-DOS" (IBM versions will say
  either "Starting PC DOS" or "Starting IBM DOS").  When you see this
  message, press your F8 function key.  You will then be prompted to
  confirm each line of your current CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files.
  This will allow you to temporarily turn off the programs that you do not
  need or that may be causing problems.  ONLY ANSWER "YES" TO THE LINES
  SHOWN ABOVE AND THE "OK to process AUTOEXEC.BAT?"  QUESTION.  When
  finished, you will be left at a plain C:\> prompt.

  NOTE:  Pressing the Left Shift or F5 function key at the "Starting MS-DOS"
         prompt will not work properly.  Shadow Warrior requires at least 30
         available "file handles" to operate properly.  This is defined by the
         FILES=30 statement in your CONFIG.SYS file.  If you bypass your
         CONFIG.SYS file completely by pressing Left Shift or F5, you are stuck
         with the DOS default of 8 file handles.  You will experience errors if
         you attempt to run the game this way.

  If you are more familiar with DOS, we strongly recommend that you set up
  a multi-boot option.  These newer versions of DOS allow you to set up
  multiple boot configuration sections in your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT
  files, mostly eliminating the need for boot disks.  Again, please consult
  your DOS manual for instructions on how to create a boot disk, or a
  multi-boot configuration using the parameters stated above.

  3D Realms has set up a section on our web site for multi-boot configurations
  in Windows95.  This is our recommended way of playing with Windows.  Please
  see http://www.3drealms.com/tech/multiboot.html for more information.

  Shadow Warrior is a protected mode program, and as such does not require the
  services of such memory managers as QEMM, EMM386, etc.  Please read the
  section of this file on protected mode programs for more information.  Please
  note that using MicroSoft's Memmaker or QEMM's Optimize will not do you any
  good if you're out of memory.  You need to "boot clean".  Please see the
  "Boot Clean" section of this tech file and the "Protected Mode" section for
  more information.

þ If your copy of Shadow Warrior locks up randomly and you have a sound card,
  you might be experiencing a DMA conflict.  These are caused by having more
  than one hardware device sharing a DMA (Direct Memory Access) channel with
  your sound card.  DMA channels are used by Shadow Warrior to send sounds to
  your sound card.  When you have more than one piece of hardware on a single
  DMA channel, the chip on your motherboard that controls DMA transfers may
  become confused and send the sound to the wrong place.  When this happens,
  your system will lock up.

  Devices that usually cause DMA conflicts include CD-ROM drives, older
  dedicated FAX boards, tape backup drives connected to an accelerator card
  (not including tape drives plugged into your floppy drive controller cable),
  and in newer systems, the ECP/EPP parallel port on your I/O card or on the
  motherboard itself.  If any of these devices are present on your system, they
  may be the source of your lockups.

  DMA conflicts cannot usually be spotted by diagnostic software (CheckIt, PC
  Tools SI.EXE, Norton Utilities NDIAGS, etc.).  3D Realms does not recommend
  the use of such software to determine if you have a DMA conflict. Instead, if
  you suspect a DMA conflict, try the following test:

       1.  Run the SETUP program and select NONE for your Sound FX card.
       2.  Play Shadow Warrior and watch for lockups.

  If the game no longer locks up, then you were definitely experiencing a DMA
  conflict between your sound card and some other device.

  The ONLY way to resolve a DMA conflict is to physically move the conflicting
  device to another DMA channel.  In all but the rarest cases involving devices
  that "download" their configuration at boot-up time, you cannot do this
  through software.  You also cannot solve the problem by simply unloading the
  driver for the conflicting device.  Since this is a true hardware conflict,
  the problem can persist even if the device driver is not loaded when you boot
  your machine. In laymen's terms, booting clean won't solve the problem.  You
  will most likely have to move a "jumper" (see your manuals for a description)
  to physically reconfigure the conflicting device.  If you need assistance
  with reconfiguring your device(s), please consult your system's manuals or
  contact the manufacturer of the device(s) in question.  3D Realms cannot
  provide assistance for reconfiguring your hardware.

  For best performance, do not move your sound card to a different channel:
  leave it where it is (usually channel 1 for 8-bit cards, or channels 1 and 5
  for 16-bit cards).  Instead, move the conflicting device.  After you have
  resolved the DMA conflict, you may re-run the SETUP program and re-select
  your sound card under the Sound FX setup.

  If your copy of Shadow Warrior still locks up, you may wish to check some
  settings in your CMOS configuration as a last resort.  If any of these are
  on, then switch them off:   Hidden Refresh, Hardware Video Shadowing, Turbo
  Switching. Also, if you have either of these, turn them on: HD1 Block Mode;
  IDE HDD Block Mode.  Use these ONLY as a "last resort" fix - make sure you
  read the rest of this file before you try these suggestions.

þ There are a few command line parameters (also known as "switches") you
  can use to alter game performance.  Some of these will help speed up the
  game on slow computers, while others help to aid game play.

  A command line parameter is something that you type on the command line
  after the name of the program you're running.  The '/v' switch will be used
  as an example.  To use that one, you would need to start the game like this:

                                   SW -v1

  The command line parameters for Shadow Warrior are stackable, which means
  that you can use more than one at a time, if you need to.  An example of a
  stacked set of command line parameters would look like this...

                                   SW -v1 -l1

  Please note that while these are intended for use with the game, you can use
  them on the setup program.  The setup program will pass any command line
  parameters that were given to it to the game.

  Here is a list of the command line parameters you can use with Shadow
  Warrior:  ('-' may be used instead of '/', <> text is optional)

  -?                     This help message

  -map <mapname>         Load a map
                         In the registered version, this lets you load a
                         custom map file via the command line.  If used, this
                         needs to be the first command line switch.

  -nocd<audio>           No CD Red Book Audio
                         For the registered version only, this will disable
                         the CD Audio detection.

  -name [playername]     Player Name
                         Overrides the player name in the sw.cfg file.

                         network game, and is intended only for places like
                         TEN who use a slightly different arrangement which
                         requires less traffic.  This would also be useful
                         for programs such as Kali, etc. # can be 2, 4, or 8.

  -nopred<ict>           Disable Net Prediction Method
                         This should never really be needed, but if you're
                         having sync problems, you can try using this parameter
                         to alleviate them.  This will slow down the game a
                         bit, though.

NOTE: The following command line parameters should never be used during
      standard game play.  These can seriously upset the stability of game
      play, we do not recommend you use these unless you know exactly what you
      are doing.

                      ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

NOTE: In order to play a Network game, you must have IPX/SPX or NetBIOS
      network protocols loaded.  Please see your network manual, or contact
      your network administrator for info on how to load these.  3D Realms
      cannot help you with setting up your network.  (We also cannot help with
      support on playing the game over Ten, Kali, or Kahn or any other program
      that emulates a network over TCP/IP.  Please contact the people who make
      the program in question for using games on their software.)

A network isn't something to find, or something you can share with your
friends in other towns, and it doesn't involve just living in the same area. A
network consists of a series of computers with network cards that physically
link the computers by a network cable.  To network your systems together, all
the computers would have to be in the same room or building.  The greater the
distance (up to 300ft) increases the cost of the cable. You can find cards for
around $20 each and cable will run from $15 for a 50ft patch cable to $130 for
500ft. roll that you can cut for the desired length. If you need more info,
check out a book from your library or book store like "LAN for dummies".   It
explains it in plain English.

Here is a short summary of how to play a network game.  A more detailed
explanation will follow.

1) Run the setup program.  Once in the setup program, select "Network Game".
2) Alter any of the options you wish, and then select "Launch Shadow Warrior".
3) Once all the players are found, the game will load.  Once the game is at
   the Main Menu, select "New Game".
4) If you are Player 1, you will choose the game options.  All other players
   will have to wait for Player 1 to select the game options.
5) If you are player 1, select the difficulty, level, etc, and select "Begin
   Play".  You're in!

Here's a more detailed description of the Network Game Options:

1) Run the Setup program, and select "Network Game".  From here, you can alter
   several game parameters before actually launching Shadow Warrior.  The
   parameters you can change are:

   Number of Players  -> This option will let you alter the total number of
                         players to be found in your game.
   Network Socket #   -> This will allow more than one simultaneous network
                         game to occur at once.  If you change this, all people
                         playing in your game must be using the same value, or
                         you won't find each other.
   Setup Macros       -> From here you can set up the text taunts you can use
                         during WangBangs.  During play, you activate them by
                         hitting Shift-F1 through Shift-F10.
   Change RTS File    -> This will let you alter the RemoteRidicule (tm) sound
                         file.  By default, this is SW.RTS.  The RTS file is
                         the file that contains recorded voice taunts you can
                         throw at your opponents during a WangBang.  These are
                         activated by pressing Alt-F1 through Alt-F10.  NOTE:
                         If you are using a custom RTS file, ALL players must
                         have the same RTS file in order to hear your taunts.
   Change Player Name -> When you are playing multi-player SW, you are known
                         to other players by the name you choose here.
   Launch Shadow Warr -> Once you've selected all your options, choose this
                         to run the game!  DO NOT use the launch option from
                         the Main Menu.  If you intend on playing a Network
                         game, you must use this option.

2) Once you've hit "Launch Shadow Warrior", the game will be run.  Once at the
   Main Menu, hit "New Game".  If you are Player 1, then you will have a few
   more things to do.  If you are any other player, you are done.  Just sit
   wait for Player 1 to set all the options.

NOTE: On a network game, Player #1 is determined by whomever has the lowest
      network ID number.  There is no way to force the game to assign a
      specific player to be #1.  You'll need to check with your network
      administrator / network documentation to change network ID numbers.

3) If you are Player 1, you have several items you need to select before the
   game will actually start.  They are:

   a) Game Type     -> There are three options here.  They are WangBang,
                       WangBang [No Spawn], and Cooperative. Cooperative is
                       a way of playing "against the game". In other words,
                       you and your friend(s) both play with each other.
                       WangBang means you and your buddies just blast each
                       other! A WangBang game with no spawn means that the
                       ammo, health, & items do not come back after having
                       been picked up/used.
   b) Level         -> This is a slidebar that allows you to select which
                       level you will play in, and the name of the episode
                       is shown on the next line.
   c) Markers       -> Show respawn markers.  These will show or not show the
                       small circles that "mark" a spot where an item will
                       "respawn" back into the game.
   d) Kill Limit    -> This is a slidebar that allows you to select the end
                       of a WangBang if a certain number of kills has been
                       reached.  By default this is unlimited, but it can
                       be changed to any of the values on the slidebar here.
                       You can choose any number from 10 to 100 in increments
                       of ten.  This option is not available if you are
                       playing CoOp.
   e) Time Limit    -> This is similar to the kill limit slidebar except that
                       the end of the game is determined by time, not kills.
                       You can choose any of the options here which range from
                       3 minutes to 60 minutes or unlimited.  This option is
                       not available if you are playing CoOp.
   f) Player Color  -> You can choose pants color with this.  NOTE: When using
                       team play, this is how you determine teams.  Make sure
                       that if you are playing in team mode, that your team
                       chooses the same pants color.
   g) Other Options -> There are four more options available under the "Other
                       Options" menu. They are:
                       1) Monsters: You can have no monsters, or three levels
                                    of monster difficulty.
                       2) Team Play: You can play in teams.  The way to tell
                                     who is on a team is by the color of the
                                     pants selected.  Make sure that all
                                     players on the same team have the same
                                     pants color. If you select CoOp play,
                                     this option is not available.
                       3) Hurt Teammate: If this is selected, you can hurt your
                                         own teammate, or your friend if you
                                         are playing CoOp.
                       4) Play w/Nuke: If you wish to disable the "Nuke" weapon
                                       you can do it here.  This will
                                       eliminate any whining about
                                       "unfair".

   h) Start Game    -> Once the parameters have been selected, this starts!

4) Select Option "h" (from the list above) and start your new game!

þ NETWORK PLAY NOTES AND REMARKS

  ¯ You cannot join a game in progress.  All players must be present at the
    start of the game.  If you quit, you cannot rejoin without everyone else
    quitting and restarting.

  ¯ If you are playing a network game and any player quits the game, the rest
    will continue to play.

  ¯ If you are playing in Co-Operative mode, pressing the letter "K" during
    play will let you see through the eyes of your teammates.

NOTE: In order to play a Modem game of Shadow Warrior, you need a 100% Hayes
      Compatible modem of at least 14400bps or faster.  We also strongly
      recommend a serial port with a 16550 UART chip.  Older 16450's or 8250's
      are not fast enough and can cause synchronization errors and slowdowns.
      If you have one of these older ports, please upgrade to a serial card.
      with a 16550 UART.  If you have a software supported or an emulated
      port, it will not be detected as a 16550.  You need a TRUE 16550 for it
      to be detected as such.

Problems with Modem Play?  Please see the HELP!!! - Modem / Serial Play section
of this document.  Press F7 now to see a list of sections.

  We strongly urge you NOT TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT MODEM INIT STRINGS UNLESS YOU
  ARE SURE THE CHANGED SETTINGS WILL WORK.  Changing them tends to cause
  problems, and you should only change them if the defaults do not work.

Here is a short summary of how to play a modem game.  A more detailed
explanation will follow.

1) Run the setup program.  Once in the setup program, select "Modem Game".
2) Make sure your COM Port is set up correctly (Select Setup COM Port).  We
   strongly recommend picking a port speed of only 19200 until you are sure you
   can connect properly.
3) If you are calling, select "Phone Number List" and pick a phone number to
   call, then select "Dial Your Opponent".  After this, pick "Launch Shadow
   Warrior" If you are the one being called, select "Wait For Call", and then
   select "Launch Shadow Warrior".
3) Once all the players are found, the game will load.  Once the game is at
   the Main Menu, select "New Game".
4) Set the options, and begin!

Here's a more detailed description of the Modem Game Options:

1) Run the Setup program and select "Modem game".  From here, you can alter
   several game parameters before actually launching Shadow Warrior.  The
   parameters you can change are as follows.

   --  You can only choose one of the first three options at any one time. --
        -- The rest of these options are modem configuration options. --

   Already Connected  -> Choose this if you have already connected with a
                         terminal software package such as Qmodem or Telix.

   Wait For Call      -> Choose this if you are playing a modem game and wish
                         to have your friend call you.

   Dial your Opponent -> Choose this if you are playing a modem game and wish
                         to be the one who dials the phone.

   Setup Com Port     -> This option lets you configure the COM port you wish
                         to use for playing Modem SW. This is where you would
                         need to select COM 1 or 2, the IRQ, UART, and/or Port
                         Speed.  We recommend against changing the IRQ or UART
                         values unless instructed to by 3D Realms Tech Support,
                         or unless you are 100% certain of what you are doing.

   Setup Modem        -> Shadow Warrior used an advanced modem driver, and as
                         such, you don't need to mess with fiddly init strings.
                         The default of just "ATZ" will work with 99% of the
                         modems out there.  If, for some reason, you find you
                         need to alter your modem init string from ATZ, this is
                         where you would do it.  Also, if you need to change
                         from TONE to PULSE dialing, or add a 9 to get an
                         outside line, or some other similar modem condition,
                         this is where you would do it.

   If you do need to change the init string, please consult your modem's
   instruction manual, 3D Realms cannot help with setting up specific modem
   strings.  All you need to do is to disable error correction and data
   compression in your init string.

   Setup Macros       -> This option lets you set up the text based taunts you
                         can use during a WangBang game.

   Change RTS File    -> This will let you pick a different RemoteRidicule(tm)
                         sound file, if you have made or received one.  The
                         default filename here is SW.RTS.  The RTS file is
                         the file that contains recorded voice taunts you can
                         throw at your opponents during WangBangs.  These are
                         activated by pressing Alt-F1 through Alt-F10.  NOTE:
                         If you are using a custom RTS file, ALL players must
                         have the same RTS file in order to hear your taunts.

   Change Player Name -> When you are playing multi-player SW, you are known
                         to other players by the name you choose here.

   Phone Number List  -> This option lets you set up a dialing directory of all
                         your friends who play Modem SW, so you don't have to
                         enter their phone numbers every time you want to play.

Launch Shadow Warrior -> Once you've selected all the options for your modem
                         game, select this to start!

2) Once you've hit "Launch Shadow Warrior", the game will run.  Once at the
   Main Menu, hit "New Game", and the pick the game options!

3) When setting options, you have several items you need to select before the
   game will actually start.  They are:

   a) Game Type     -> There are three options here.  They are WangBang,
                       WangBang [No Spawn], and CoOperative. Cooperative is
                       a way of playing "against the game". In other words,
                       you and your friend(s) both play with each other.
                       WangBang means you and your buddies just blast each
                       other! A WangBang game with no spawn means that the
                       ammo, health, & items do not come back after having
                       been picked up/used.
   b) Level         -> This is a slidebar that allows you to select which
                       level you will play in, and the name of the episode
                       is shown on the next line.
   c) Markers       -> Show respawn markers.  These will show or not show the
                       small circles that "mark" a spot where an item will

   d) Kill Limit    -> This is a slidebar that allows you to select the end
                       of a WangBang if a certain number of kills has been
                       reached.  By default this is unlimited, but it can
                       be changed to any of the values on the slidebar here.
                       You can choose any number from 10 to 100 in increments
                       of ten.  This option is not available if you are
                       playing CoOp.
   e) Time Limit    -> This is similar to the kill limit slidebar except that
                       the end of the game is determined by time, not kills.
                       You can choose any of the options here which range from
                       3 minutes to 60 minutes or unlimited.  This option is
                       not available if you are playing CoOp.
   f) Player Color  -> You can choose pants color with this.  NOTE: When using
                       team play, this is how you determine teams.  Make sure
                       that if you are playing in team mode, that your team
                       chooses the same pants color.
   g) Other Options -> There are four more options available under the "Other
                       Options" menu. They are:
                       1) Monsters: You can have no monsters, or three levels
                                    of monster difficulty.
                       2) Team Play: You can play in teams.  The way to tell
                                     who is on a team is by the color of the
                                     pants selected.  Make sure that all
                                     players on the same team have the same
                                     pants color. If you select CoOp play,
                                     this option is not available.
                       3) Hurt Teammate: If this is selected, you can hurt your
                                         own teammate, or your friend if you
                                         are playing CoOp.
                       4) Play w/Nuke: If you wish to disable the "Nuke" weapon
                                       you can do it here.

   h) Start Game    -> Once the parameters have been selected, this starts!

4) Select Option "H" and start your new game.

NOTE: In order to play a serial game of Shadow Warrior, you will need a null
      modem cable (not a serial cable with a null modem adapter).  We also
      strongly recommend a serial card with a 16550 UART chip.  The older 16450
      and 8250 chips can cause slowdowns and problems during setup and
      gameplay.

Playing a serial game of Shadow Warrior is quite easy.  All you need to do is
make sure that you have your two computers connected via a null modem cable.
After you have hooked the computers together, run the setup program and select
"Serial Game".  From there, if you need to, you can configure your COM port
(make sure it is using the correct port for your computer).  You can also alter
such WangBang items as Text taunt macros, the RTS (RemoteRidicule) file to be
used, and your Player Name.  Once you've done this, select "Launch Shadow
Warrior".

If you do not connect, check and make sure that the cable you are using is a
true null modem cable.  Standard "straight-through" serial cables and (in most
cases) serial cables with a null modem adapter will not work.  Also, check and
make sure that both sides are opening the serial port at the same speed.  We
strongly urge you to leave it at the default of 19200 until you are sure you
can properly play the game.

Player 1 and Player 2 are assigned at run time.  If you've been selected as
Player 1, you have several items you need to select before the game will
actually start.  They are:

   a) Game Type     -> There are three options here.  They are WangBang,
                       WangBang [No Spawn], and CoOperative. Cooperative is

   c) Markers       -> Show respawn markers.  These will show or not show the
                       small circles that "mark" a spot where an item will
                       "respawn" back into a game.
   d) Kill Limit    -> This is a slidebar that allows you to select the end
                       of a WangBang if a certain number of kills has been
                       reached.  By default this is unlimited, but it can
                       be changed to any of the values on the slidebar here.
                       You can choose any number from 10 to 100 in increments

                                     this option is not available.
                       3) Hurt Teammate: If this is selected, you can hurt your
                                         own teammate, or your friend if you
                                         are playing CoOp.
                       4) Play w/Nuke: If you wish to disable the "Nuke" weapon
                                       you can do it here.

            ³WHAT IS THE "SET BLASTER" COMMAND, AND WHY DO I NEED IT?³
            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

If you are using a Sound Blaster clone, then this section is of particular
interest to you.  A good deal of Sound Blaster clones do not properly set up
the SET BLASTER command.  If you have a clone card and do not get any sound (or
poor/bad sound), this is probably why.

Shadow Warrior (or any other Apogee/3D Realms game that uses the Sound Blaster)
uses the SET BLASTER command to figure out where to send its sound output. A
Sound Blaster card can have many different sound outputs, and since there are
zillions of computers out there, a way needs to be used in order to tell the
game where your sound card is located.  The SET BLASTER line is how we do it.
Check to make sure that you have the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT
file.  This code is an example, and isn't exactly what you need to put in your
system, make sure to read the entire explanation of this command.

NOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of
      cards.  For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE32.  The
      minimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters.  The other
      three may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.
      Please read this entire section to see if you need any of them.  If you
      are using a clone card, or some card that's not a "true" Sound Blaster,
      then you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T6 P330 H6 E620
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |  |
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |  |_______ AWE32 Only Parameter
|   |       |    |  |  |  |    |__________ "High" DMA Channel
|   |       |    |  |  |  |_______________ MIDI Port
|   |       |    |  |  |__________________ Type of Card
|   |       |    |  |_____________________ DMA Channel
|   |       |    |________________________ Interrupt
|   |       |_____________________________ Port Address
|   |_____________________________________ Environment Variable
|_________________________________________ DOS Command

NOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).
If you have a space in there, your system will set the parameter incorrectly.
Our games will not be able to recognize the command and will not work properly.

These settings will most likely not be the ones you need for your board.  This
is the case since the Port Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by
adjusting "jumpers" on your sound card.  Some newer cards have this information
controlled by software, so please consult your card's manual for more
information on how to set these things.  You should also check your manual if
you are unclear as to how to tell what settings your card is using.  This
information *IS* important, so we recommended that you know precisely what the
settings are.  If you are using a card that "emulates" the Sound Blaster, you
should check your card's manual on how to set up the card for Sound Blaster
emulation (if your card is not natively supported by this game).

The settings shown in the above example are based on the defaults used for a
Sound Blaster AWE32.  Here is an explanation of each setting, along with the
most commonly used settings:

The PORT ADDRESS is almost always 220.  This seems to be the default for
most Sound Blasters and compatibles, regardless of brand.  Unless you know
you've switched this away from 220, it's a safe bet it's still there.

The INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system.  IRQ 5 is most
common on newer true Sound Blaster cards, while older Sound Blasters and some
clones (regardless of age) default to IRQ 7.  While many IRQs are available,
3D Realms does not recommend using IRQ 2 or IRQ 10.  Most of the people we
run into who use IRQ 2 have difficulty getting their programs to run properly,
unless they switch to a different IRQ channel.  Also, while IRQ 10 may work,
we cannot guarantee that it will.  Finally, if you are using a Gravis
Ultrasound or Ultrasound Max, you must use an IRQ of 7 or less.  The sound
engine used in this game does not support the GUS default of 11.

NOTE: Our sound engine doesn't support IRQ9 for Sound Cards.  If you have yours
      at IRQ9, try picking IRQ2 in the setup program.  A lot of systems,
      especially those running under Windows swap out IRQ9 and 2.

The DMA CHANNEL is one that causes some people problems.  By default, this is
almost always set at 1.  Unless you have a specific need to change this, it's
probably still at 1.  If you're running into lockups using digitized sounds
with our games, this is probably where your problem lies. If you get lockups
with a 3D Realms game that has digitized sounds and you have this variable set
properly, try turning off the digitized sounds.  If the game now plays without
locking up, you probably have a DMA conflict.  Please see the "Shadow Warrior
Detailed Help & TroubleShooting" section of this file for instructions on
fixing this problem.

The TYPE OF CARD is something that is fairly easy to check out.  If you're
running a non-Creative Labs sound card, then you want this to either be 1 or 3,
depending on which card it is.  In the majority of cases, it will be a 1 if
you are not using a "true" Sound Blaster.  If you do have a "true" Sound
Blaster, then the variable is one of these...

      1 for an original (old) Sound Blaster.
      2 for an original (old) Sound Blaster Pro.
      3 for a newer Sound Blaster 2.0 (Sound Blaster deluxe edition).
      4 for a newer Sound Blaster Pro (SB Pro 2.0)
      5 for a MicroChannel Sound Blaster (IBM PS/2 MCA-bus systems only).
      6 for a Sound Blaster 16, Vibra 16, or an AWE32.

As shown here, the age of the card can make a difference.  If you have an older
card like the Sound Blaster 1.5, choose the appropriate number.  Clone cards or
cards that emulate the Sound Blaster usually have a T variable of 1.
Experiment to see what works best for you.

The MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has
MIDI capabilities.  Your sound card manual will tell you if you need this.  It
is generally used only on true Sound Blaster cards, specifically the SB16 and
higher.  If your card requires it, this is where you define what MIDI port you
are using.  330 seems to be the default for most cards, so if you have such a
card, and you haven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably
where it still is.

The HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16,
Vibra 16 (built into some motherboards), and AWE32 cards.  This is not the same
as the standard (or "low") DMA channel:  this is a different one.  This is only
used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing 16 bit Sound Blaster
sounds.  By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know that it's something
else, it's probably still 5.

Please note that this parameter can cause lockups on some systems.  Creative
Labs' installation programs warn that some motherboards cannot handle 16-bit
DMA transfers, which is used if you select the default high DMA channel of 5.
If you experience game lockups, try reconfiguring your card and this setting to
use DMA channel 1 (i.e., the same channel that is used for the D parameter).
See your card's documentation for details on this problem.

The E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative
Labs AWE32 sound card.  If you have one of these, this parameter will have been
set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the card.
Check your AWE32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what this
parameter is used for.

We get a lot of questions from people wanting to know why they have to use this
if they don't have a true Sound Blaster.  It's simple, really - the command has
NOTHING to do with what brand of sound card you have.  3D Realms games that use
digitized sounds expect Sound Blasters and compatibles to be at specific
settings.  If they are not, then the game needs to be told this.  The way to do
this is with the BLASTER environment variable.  That's why this is needed. Some
of our newer programs (Shadow Warrior, Duke3D) have specific setup programs
which let you set up this information manually, but they still require the SET
BLASTER line to operate at 100% efficiency.

Please remember to add this to AUTOEXEC.BAT, save the file back to disk,
reboot your computer, and make sure to delete the game's config file
(SW.CFG) before running the game again.  If you have any further questions,
please drop 3D Realms a line.

Shadow Warrior is only officially supported under the following operating
systems:

                 Microsoft MS-DOS (versions 5.0 through 6.22)
                     IBM PC DOS (versions 5.0 through 7.0)
                                 Novell DOS 7

This game was designed to be run only under these environments.  It was not
designed for use under any other operating system, including Windows 95, OS/2
Warp, or on a Macintosh using a DOS compatibility card.  For this reason, 3D
Realms cannot provide technical support for problems running the game under
these environments.  If you experience problems, contact the company that made
your operating system.

Please see http://www.3drealms.com/tech/multiboot.html for more information
on Windows95 and booting into DOS mode.

PLEASE NOTE:  While Microsoft Windows 95 has the ability to boot in "MS-DOS
Mode", this is still not a supported environment.  Microsoft has made many
changes to the version of MS-DOS (v7.0) that is integrated into Windows 95.
These changes have been known to cause Shadow Warrior to fail to operate on
some systems, while they have caused no problems on other systems.  If you
choose to try to run Shadow Warrior in MS-DOS mode on your system, be advised
that you do so at your own risk.  Neither 3D Realms Entertainment nor Apogee
Software can be held responsible for any problems that you may encounter, nor
can we provide technical support for such problems.

There is no known way to get this game running fully under Windows NT.  The
problem lies with NT itself, as NT does not allow the same kind of hardware
access to our product that other MicroSoft OS's do.

The only known way to get Shadow Warrior running under NT is to play with no
sound. Other than that, you'll need to boot over to DOS.

                            ³WHAT IS PROTECTED MODE?³
                            ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

As promised earlier in this document, here is an explanation of protected mode.
This information is not necessary to get the game running, but it's included as
background information for the curious.

Historically, DOS programs have always required that you run them in the first
640k of ram.  This was a limitation imposed on DOS back when v1.0 was the only
thing around.  For compatibility's sake, this is the way things have remained.
Any memory above 640k could only be used for data storage, not for program
execution.  That's why you always saw those dreaded "Out of Memory" messages.

As time went on, certain programs, (and later DOS itself) gained the ability to
load part of themselves "high", leaving more conventional (the first 640k) of
memory available.  You still had the limitation of the 640k barrier, but some
more breathing room was made by these memory advances.

More recently, advances were made in memory management so that programs could
run in protected mode.  Protected mode is a special way of programming so that
your program doesn't have the 640k barrier.  Depending on how the program is
written, the entire thing is in protected mode, or it requires the use of a DOS
"Extender" to run that way.  Shadow Warrior is such a program.  Shadow Warrior
uses a DOS extender to access much more memory than it would have been able to
if it were written the old way.  A game of this complexity would have never
been able to have been written if the old 640k barrier method of programming
was used.

Well, you might be asking, what about my older programs?  Can't I just use a
DOS extender, and have that run something like "Wolfenstein 3D", and never get
those out of memory errors?  Well, it's not as simple as that.  If a program is
using a DOS extender, it has to be written a special way.  A DOS extender isn't
just a magic wand that you can use to wipe away your memory problems for
non-protected mode programs.  The program has to be written a special way to
make use of the DOS extender.

To summarize, protected mode (sometimes referred to as the "flat memory" model)
is a way for a DOS program (either by itself, or through the use of a DOS
extender) to access more than just the first 640k of memory for program
execution.  Because of this, more complex programs (such as SW) are able to
be written.  If using the old 640k barrier method (sometimes referred to as a
"segmented memory" model), this type of program would not have been possible.

If you're still confused, don't worry about it.  As I said above, this
information is not necessary for the proper play of Shadow Warrior.  It's in
here for background information only.  If you're still inclined, check out some
DOS programming books available at your library or a book store.  They have far
more detailed explanations of this than would be possible in this document.

3D Realms has a forum on CompuServe!  Our forum has all of our shareware (as
well as Apogee's, too!) available for download.  It also has other helpful
files, as well as some user submitted files!  If you are on CompuServe, and
haven't checked out our forum, why not try it today?

     ¯ CompuServe: Type "GO REALMS" at any ! prompt

þ Internet Services

WORLD WIDE WEB:

3D Realms has its own World Wide Web Site!  Point your Web Browser to the URL
http://www.3drealms.com, and you'll reach us on the Web!  We have all kinds of
cool files and information here, so if you like Apogee or 3D Realms and you're
on the Web, you need to be here!  You can learn about future games, take a
"virtual tour" of our headquarters, and participate in the lively message
bases!

INTERNET MAILING LIST:

FTP FILE TRANSFER:

3D Realms an official Anonymous FTP site for our shareware downloads:

               ftp://wuarchive.wustl.edu/systems/msdos/games/3dr/

This is a standard Anonymous FTP site.  If you're getting an error like
"Anonymous Access Denied", "Cannot Access File", or something like that, you're
probably just running into the limit.  All Anonymous FTP sites have limits to
the number of people that can access it at once.  Think of it as a busy signal,
and try again later.  We also recommend talking to your local Internet Service
provider (or the author of your FTP software) about how to properly use the
Internet program you're trying to use.
