DEMO FAQ

Q. What do I do when my cockpit view keeps changing ?
A You probably need to recalibrate your joystick's coolie hat, 
  Press ALT J. The view will start shifting, press the coolie 
  hat up with your thumb, and you should be in the gunner view 
  point and the joystick will be correctly set.

Q. What should I do if the Demo ABORTS?
A.  If the game ABORTS on you please run SCANDISK to be sure
   that any allocated virtual memory disk space is released.  Re-runnig 
   the game will also free up and reuse the disk space.

Q. What is the difference between Arcade and Invincible modes in 
   the main menu of the demo ?
A. In Arcade mode you are flying shooting down targets and can be 
   shot down, but when you die or crash the game will record your 
   high score. In invincible mode you are unstoppable, and cannot 
   be shot down, but the game will not record your high score. 

Q. I was flying in  invincible mode and the game went back to the 
   menu screen without any warning, it also did not put my high  
   score on the list.
A. This is just a demo version of Apache and you only have a limited 
   amount of flying time (10 minutes). In invincible mode, your score
    is not recorded. This would be unfair to the people flying in Arcade 
   mode who run the risk of being shot down.

Q. What is the difference between Realistic and Arcade mode of 
   flight in the Preferences screen ?
A. With Realistic flight you are able to do rolls, loops and exploit 
   the true potential of the Apache flight model. In Arcade mode you 
   are not able to do rolls and loops, but the Apache is easier to 
   control and does not require the degree of manual dexterity that 
   Realistic flight requires.
