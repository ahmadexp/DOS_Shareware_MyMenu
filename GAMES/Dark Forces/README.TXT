I) INSTRUCTIONS FOR INSTALLING AND RUNNING DARK FORCES DEMO:

1. Create a directory for the demo on your hard drive.
   (ex. C:\DFDEMO)

2. Extract the demo using PKUNZIP.EXE into the demo
   directory.  If you have downloaded one or both of
   the cutscene files, then unzip them as well.

3. From the demo directory, type "demo" and  RETURN. This will
   bring you to the install menu. From the install menu, follow
   the on-screen instructions. Press "I" to install. This will
   take you through through the sound card setup program. When
   the install is finished it will bring you to the options
   menu. From there you type "1" to run Dark Forces. In the
   future, in order to get to the options menu, you should
   type "demo" from the your demo directory.



II) SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
- 486 Microprocessor or better recommended
- 8 Megabytes of RAM
- Sound Blaster TM-compatible or Pro AudioSpectrum TM sound card
- Microsoft TM-compatible Mouse


III) MAKING A BOOTDISK FROM BOOTMKR.EXE:

A Boot Disk is  a floppy disk that, when inserted in your A:
drive before startup, will load only the software necessary to play
the samplers.  BOOTMKR requires a clean floppy disk that it may re-format
and erase, so be sure to acquire a clean disk before making your boot disk.
To run BOOTMKR,  press "4" from the main menu after typing
install.  Simply follow the instructions and voila! Your new boot disk is
ready for use.

have invincible on you are safe from enemy fire but could still die in a fall.

Sound F/X Volume- Sliding the bar controls the volume of the digital sounds.

Music Volume- Sliding the bar which controls the volume of the music.


VIII) PERSONAL DATA ASSISTANT OR PDA:

You can access your PDA by pressing F1 on the keyboard. The display
will overlay your viewscreen. You will see five buttons at the bottom
which , when clicked, access the five PDA functions (described below)

MAP- Displays all the territory you have already explored. The
[arrow display] or arrow keys on your keyboard move you around the map.
The [zoom display] or the + or - keys on your keyboard allow you to zoom
in or out for close up or overhead shots. The [layers display] or brackets
on your keyboard toggle you through the different floors of  the building.

WEAP (weapons)- Displays all weapons you are currently carrying, the type
of ammo it uses and the keyboard key that brings it up.

INV (inventory)- Displays all non- weapon items in your inventory

OBJ (objective)- Displays mission objectives. The buttons to the left of each objective
are filled in as you complete them.

MIS (mission)- Displays the text of your mission briefing.

IX)THE HEADS UP DISPLAY:

The Heads Up Display (or HUD) shows certain vital information you will want
to constantly monitor.  The two green arcs on the left side show your shield
status with corresponding numerical measurement below in green, and the red
arc monitors your vital signs to give you an overall health reading, also
with a corresponding numerical value below in red. The red number to the
right represents your "lives".  When a life is lost, continue play by
pressing Space.  The right side of the HUD displays your battery power/
weapons status.  The large red number displays either your  power units
(the equivalent of ammunition) for pistol/rifle type weapons, or the number
of actual units in the case of grenades or mines (timed floor explosives).
Certain accessories (such as light goggles) may cause a drain on your
battery power, so use them sparingly.  The smaller green number represents
the number  of rockets for your rocket launcher, and only appears when you
use this weapon.


X) USING "SET SOUNDBOARD" TO MANUALLY CONFIGURE YOUR SOUNDCARD:

After selecting the "Set Sound Board" option from the install program
you will be asked to choose either Express Setup or Custom Setup.
If the install program fails to configure your sound board automatically
then you should choose Custom Setup.  If you have added a new sound
board to your system, or changed your sound board configuration, then
select Express Setup and the program will attempt to set up your sound
board automatically.

From the Custom Setup Standard Menu you can choose from the sound
standards supported by Dark Forces and manually set the Port, IRQ, DMA,
and Stereo Reverse settings.  You can also test your configuration for
both music and sound.  In some cases, you may want to select the
Advanced Menu.  This menu allows you to select the Music and Digital
Sound standards for Dark Forces independently of each other.  This is
most useful for systems with more than one sound board, or sound boards
which support more than one standard.

XI)SOUND CARD ISSUES:

MediaVisiontm Pro Audio Spectrum 16 and Pro Audio Studiotm Users:
  The default keyboard layout for Dark Forces reserves the CTRL and ALT keys
  for game functions.  If you wish to adjust the volume of your Pro Audio
  Spectrum using the CTRL+ALT+U or CTRL+ALT+D hotkeys, you must do so before
  starting the game.  Another option is to reconfigure the 'Fire' and 'strafe'
  functions to use keys other than the CTRL or ALT keys. You can do this from
  the install menu by selecting '(7) Reconfigure Dark Forces Controls'.

Soundblaster 16 and AWE 32 users:

  If your Sound Blaster 16 or AWE32 sound card is configured to use IRQ 10,
  you may have trouble getting digital sound.  If this occurs, you must
  reconfigure your sound card to use another available IRQ channel (2,5, or
  7).

  You can do this by running either SBCONFIG.EXE (Old Sound Blaster 16's) or
  DIAGNOSE.EXE (Newer SB16's and AWE32) from the directory that your sound
  card software is installed to (Usually C:\SB16).

  It is recommended that make a boot disk, using our Bootdisk Maker utility,
  before running SBCONFIG or DIAGNOSE.  When SBCONFIG or DIAGNOSE asks the
  location of your boot drive, enter A: instead of C:.  In this way you can
  change the settings of your sound card on the boot disk without affecting
  the settings stored on your hard drive.  Please consult the documentation
  that came with your sound card for more information about the SBCONFIG and
  DIAGNOSE utilities.


 Soundblaster 16 or AWE32tm and General Midi Daughter Users:

  Our General MIDI driver does not currently support any add-on Wavetable
  boards if connected to a Sound Blaster 16 or AWE32.  This includes Creative
  Labs' Wave Blaster, Media Vision's Pro Wave, or Roland's Rio daughterboards.
  The problem is related only to the Sound Blaster 16 or AWE32, thus other sound
  cards supporting these devices should play General MIDI correctly.

  If you have a Sound Blaster 16, you must use the 4-OP music driver for FM
  synthesized music (or choose the 'Express Setup' option in the sound card
  configuration utility).

  If you are using an AWE32, use the AWE32 native mode driver provided (or
  choose the 'Express Setup' option in the sound card configuration utility).


Sound Blaster AWE32 users:

  You may notice some note clipping in the music for the Dark Forces demo.


Sound Blaster Pro and Compatible sound card users:

  If your sound card is configured to use DMA 0 or DMA 3, it will fail
  to be detected by our sound set-up utility.  The card works fine at these
  settings if you use 'Custom Setup' to enter the Port, IRQ, and DMA
  values manually.

Sound Support for SoundWave 32tm Users.

  For best results with DARK FORCES  you should set your board to
  SoundBlaster with General MIDI.

  To configure DARK FORCES to use General MIDI for music do the following:

  First select "Set sound board configuration" from the main menu of the
  install program.  At the prompt, select Custom Setup and go to the
  Advanced Menu.  Select General MIDI (set the port to match the setting
  for your board) for Music and Sound Blaster 2.0 for Digital Sound (you
  can use the "Detect" command to set the port, IRQ, and DMA).

Note: These demos constitute works in progress, thus the above mentioned
sound card problems are expected to be resolved in the finished products.
