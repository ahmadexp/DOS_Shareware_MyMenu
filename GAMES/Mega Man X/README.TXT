BASIC MOVEMENT 
 
  Mega Man can be controlled with the keyboard, a joystick or with a four
  button controller.  The OPTIONS menu located on the title screen allows
  you to select any of these devices.  Below is listed basic movement for
  the CAPCOM controller that was provided with your game.

  TO MOVE LEFT OR RIGHT:      Press the controller LEFT or RIGHT.
  TO JUMP:                    Press the A button.
  TO DASH:                    Press the B button or press forward twice.
                                Running (Dash) is only possible if Mega Man
                                X is equipped with the optional Emergency
                                Acceleration System.
  TO FIRE THE X-BUSTER:       Press and hold the X button.  Weapon charge
                                increases until X button is released.
  TO SWITCH WEAPONS:          Press the TAB key to cycle through available
                                weapon systems.
  TO CLIMB A WALL:            Jump against the wall and press the A button
                                repeatedly.

MAIN POWER LEVELS 
 
  X is powered by a micro-fusion fuel tank.  His current energy level is
  indicated by an energy meter in the upper left corner of the screen.
  Each time X is damaged his energy meter will decrease.  If all his energy
  is lost,  X's fusion generator will go critical and explode.  However,
  energy depletion can be avoided by collecting the large or small yellow
  energy capsules.  Using the capsules to increase the energy meter,  X
  should be able to function indefinitely.
