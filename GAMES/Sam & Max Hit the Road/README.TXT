                        QUICK START

Just type "snmdemo".


                      MEMORY CONCERNS:

This demo requires at least 570K free base RAM in order to run.  It
will also recognize up to 2 megs. of EMS RAM, but does not require
it, however we strongly recommend you use it.  If you are using
DOS 5.0, you may utilize its ability to load certain RAM resident
programs "high" to free up base memory.  Refer to your Microsoft
documentation for further information.  You may also make a boot
disk with DOS 5.0 that will set up the optimal configuration for
running this demo.

DOS 6.0 includes a memory management utility called MEMMAKER.  It
will assist you in freeing up as much RAM as possible.  Consult
your Microsoft documentation for further information and
instructions.


                          WINDOWS:

Sam & Max Hit the Road will run under Windows.  We have included an
icon and a .pif file so that you may launch from your desktop.  The
.pif file assumes that you will install the demo into the directory
'SNMDEMO' on your C: drive.  If for some reason you have installed
the demo to a different directory or drive, you will have to change
the .pif file.  This can be done quite easily using the PIF Editor
application that comes with Windows.  All you will need to change is
the path.


                        SOUND CARDS:

In order to hear sound and music during the demo, you'll have to tell
the demo about your sound card.  You can do this by typing "install"
and choosing "Configure Sound Boards" from the main menu.

If your demo starts and no sound or music is heard, either you don't
have a sound card we currently support, or you have not configured the
demo properly.  If everything seems to be configured properly, check
your volume level and your speaker connections.

A majority of all sound problems encountered in a game have to do
with hardware communications.  This means that either 1) your game
thinks your hardware is configured in some way other than it really
is, or 2) your sound card itself is depending on either a PORT, an
IRQ number, or a DMA channel which is being used by something else
in your system.  Unfortunately, hardware configuration problems are
not always obvious.  Your game may appear to play music and sound
effects just fine, and then, at some unexpected moment, the sound
may stop, or the game may "lock up."  This is often not the fault
of the game, but a hardware conflict that didn't occur until the
game used the hardware in a particular way.  Finally -- and this is
extremely important -- just because Game A works with your
configuration and Game B doesn't, does not necessarily mean the
problem is in Game B.  It may be that Game B uses capabilites of the
hardware that Game A doesn't, and is therefore more likely to run
into problems with the hardware configuration.

If you don't know how to resolve a sound card problem, first consult
the documentation provided with your sound card.  Often sound card 
manufacturers provide diagnostic programs with their cards.
If you are still encountering difficulties, see the Technical Support
