 This demo tries to be smart and will detect a SBcard if you have one.     
 No SB no music!!                                                          

 This is only a preview, which means that the real version could have some 
 differences. (Yes a lot).
 For instance i don't like te graphics, the samples and the code.
 So the real playable Bart's Law will Have: Better Graphics 
                                            Better Sounds   
                                            Multiple frame animation
                                            Scrolling Backdrops
                                            More Soundcards support
                                            Noisetracker music
                                            Ega support (?????)

 If you like the lookes of this demo preview please leave a
 message on our BBS or write to our PO-BOXES, A postcard will do nicely
 Yep, this is postware (so the PTT gets its share of our programming)
 How more cards/messages we get, the sooner the REAL BART'S LAW will
 be released. So start writing!!!

 Don't start writing us telling that -]  It lookes like POW
                                         or where are the Simpsons
                                         etc etc etc

 We know all those things, but keep in mind that this is the product of
 one, someone with Low Programming, Sampling and Drawing capabilities

 Programming : Remco de Berk   
 Graphics    : Remco de Berk   
 Sampling    : Remco de Berk
