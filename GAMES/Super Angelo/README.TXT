FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

     Here are some questions that are often asked:

     ----

     Q:  Why doesn't the sound work?

     A:  If you have Windows 98 or above, you should be able to get sound
         via MIDI. Make sure your MIDI volume is high enough and not muted
         (see Control Panel, Multimedia / Sounds). If you are using DOS,
         you will probably be able to get sound via Adlib, if your
         soundcard soundcard supports that. The alternative is to use PC-
         speaker sound. To enable that, run ANGELO -S (see next question
         too).

     ----

     Q:  Where am I supposed to type a command line (like ANGELO -S)?

     A:  In DOS. On your windows desktop, choose Start, Programs, then
         MS-DOS prompt. Go to the directory where you installed SUPER ANGELO
         for example: CD \ANGELO, then type the command line.
