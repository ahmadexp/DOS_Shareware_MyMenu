                            1.  GETTING STARTED

         3-Demon  requires  an  IBM Personal Computer with at least
         128 kilobytes of memory, one single-sided  disk  drive,  a
         color  graphics adapter, and a black and white, or a color
         monitor.

         To start 3-Demon, simply type 3-Demon at the  DOS  command
         prompt.  After  a few seconds, you will be asked what type
         of display you have. Press the "b" key if you have a black
         and white display, or press the "c"  key  if  you  have  a
         color  display.  You will then be in the 3-Demon "attract"
         mode until you select a game level.

         To return from 3-Demon to PC-DOS, first finish playing any
         game in progress (or end the game by  pressing  the  "Esc"
         key). Then press the "Esc" key to return to PC-DOS.


                               2.  GAME PLAY

         The  object  of  3-Demon is to descend through the various
         mazes without being eaten by the ghouls.  The  measure  of
         your success is the number of points you accumulate before
         all of your lives are devoured.

         In  3-Demon  you  are not simply a voyeur, watching from a
         safe perch above the action. You are the  main  character,
         running through the hallways and fleeing from the ghouls.

         The ghouls in 3-Demon chase you through the various mazes.
         You must attempt to avoid them in your search for the food
         dots.  The power pills allow you to turn the tables on the
         ghouls, chasing and eating them. Be  careful.  Your  power
         does  not  last  forever.  When you have eaten most of the
         food in a maze, you will fall down to the next lower maze.

         The radar display aids you  in  avoiding  the  ghouls.  It
         allows  you  to  see  around  corners, giving you a slight
         advantage over the ghouls who do not possess such advanced
         technology.
