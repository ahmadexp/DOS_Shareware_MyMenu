   1.  GETTING STARTED

         3-Demon  require
s  an  IBM Personal Compu
ter with at least
         128 kilobytes of
 memory, one single-sided
  disk  drive,  a
         color  graphics 
adapter, and a black and 
white, or a color
         monitor.

         To start 3-Demon
, simply type 3-Demon at 
the  DOS  command
         prompt.  After  
a few seconds, you will b
e asked what type
         of display you h
ave. Press the "b" key if
 you have a black
         and white displa
y, or press the "c"  key 
 if  you  have  a
         color  display. 
 You will then be in the 
3-Demon "attract"
         mode until you s
elect a game level.

         To return from 3
-Demon to PC-DOS, first f
inish playing any
         game in progress
 (or end the game by  pre
ssing  the  "Esc"
         key). Then press
 the "Esc" key to return 
to PC-DOS.


                         
      2.  GAME PLAY

         The  object  of 
 3-Demon is to descend th
rough the various
         mazes without be
ing eaten by the ghouls. 
 The  measure  of
         your success is 
the number of points you 
accumulate before
         all of your live
s are devoured.

         In  3-Demon  you
  are not simply a voyeur
, watching from a
         safe perch above
 the action. You are the 
 main  character,
         running through 
the hallways and fleeing 
from the ghouls.

         The ghouls in 3-
Demon chase you through t
he various mazes.
         You must attempt
 to avoid them in your se
arch for the food
         dots.  The power
 pills allow you to turn 
the tables on the
         ghouls, chasing 
and eating them. Be  care
ful.  Your  power
         does  not  last 
 forever.  When you have 
eaten most of the
         food in a maze, 
you will fall down to the
 next lower maze.

         The radar displa
y aids you  in  avoiding 
 the  ghouls.  It
         allows  you  to 
 see  around  corners, gi
ving you a slight
         advantage over t
he ghouls who do not poss
ess such advanced
         technology.
