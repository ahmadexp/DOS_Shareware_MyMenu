8.  Other Webfoot Games

TwinBlok

Why save the universe?  Better worry 
about saving your butt!  The Time
Spinners do not look kindly on failure.
They'll yank your status, terminate your
entity, and zap you into the netherest
of the nether regions.  Your journey
begins when Executive Time Spinner (ol'
T.S., you know) drops you ill-prepared
and poorly armored into the fray,
fighting off everything the Razerrians
(antiquated holdouts from the Snarr
Sector) can drop, kick or throw at you.
Blast through their defenses, traverse
the 75 levels of time blocks they will
use to impede your travel.  They'll
tantalize you with pictures from your
home planet, hurl you through space,
instead of merely time, and dazzle you
with nefarious patterns reminiscent of
the arcades in the Neo-Draconian Sector
in a celebrated age long past.  It's no
cakewalk.  Some of the time blocks are
deceptive.  So what if you fail?  So
what, indeed!
----------------------------------------
H2O

A mind-teasing original.  FORTY levels
of graphics and mind jarring music.
Guide falling droplets to a drainpipe
at the bottom of the screen.  You won't
BELIEVE the smooth scrolling playfield!
It's not as easy as it looks, either.
Each level is a new puzzle.  H2O runs
under DOS and requires a standard VGA
graphics card.  Sound card is optional,
strongly recommended.
----------------------------------------
D.R.O.D.: Deadly Rooms of Death

A real 'killer.' More news in the
obituary columns. (Evil laugh)
In order to complete a level, Beethro
must destroy all of the monsters and
find the exit.  When all nine levels
have been cleared, Beethro will collect
enough money from King Dugan to retire
from the thankless dungeon
extermination trade and open a
restaurant.  'I'll call it Beethro's
Roasted Roach Grill!'
D.R.O.D. runs under Windows and
features detailed graphics and an
awesome MIDI sound track.
----------------------------------------
Interpose

Fulfilling the Webfoot promise of
incredible graphics and music, Interpose
is a stunningly fast scrolling action
game.  The action - and that DOES mean
action! - takes place in space.  Shoot
3D enemy ships while conserving energy
and fire-power.  Over 18 levels packed
with great graphics, music, and
animation.
----------------------------------------
Farocar

A strategy game with 200 mind-bending
levels.  Includes 3 different choices
of difficulty per level and a full level
editor.
----------------------------------------
Hopy-ONE

In the year 2013, seven of the
Planetariums decided to initiate a plan
to eradicate the F.L.V. (Fast Line
Virus), the deadliest strain of mutating
virus in the galaxy.  The virus caused
total population decimation on 17
Astrocolonies.  No survivor of the
dreaded virus was reported.  A team of
researchers assembled to obtain a sample
of the F.L.V. and devise a vaccine
against it.  Professor Jonathan Silt was
one of the team members sent to the
dying colonies.  He spent 13 years on an
intergalactic base, and was infected,
while learning about the infection of
F.L.V.  The bio-droid, HOPY-ONE, was
created in a laboratory Silt had set up
to research the virus.  Silt was
cryogenically frozen in 2026.  HOPY-
ONE's mission was to collect samples of
the virus to aid in the production of a
vaccine.  The fate of Silt, who waits in
cryosleep, and the fate of the entire
universe, rests with HOPY-ONE.

SECTION II
Instructions


----------------------------------------
System Requirements                     

- 80486 25 MHz or higher                
- 6.2 Megs of free memory               
- 22 Megs free hard drive space         
- VGA graphics card                     
- MS-DOS 5.0 or higher                  

Optional                                

- Joystick                              
- Soundcard (including SoundBlaster and 
  compatibles)                          
----------------------------------------
Getting Started

1. DOS 5.0 or higher

Type 'setup' from the directory and
drive where the game installation
program resides.

Inside the installation program:

- Choose 'OK' if the language is right,
or choose 'Change language' to change
it.

- Choose 'YES' if you have a 486-66Mhz 
or faster.

Run 'IPDEMO' to configure soundcard
and play.

----------------------------------------
2. Windows '95

Choose 'Shutdown' and 'Restart in MS-DOS
mode', or press F8 while booting and
choose 'Command prompt only'. (Gravis
UltraSound owner should run ultrinit.exe
if Windows'95 has been started).

Type 'setup' from the directory and
drive where the game installation
program resides.

Inside the installation program:

- Choose 'OK' if the language is right,
or choose 'Change language' to change
it.

- Choose 'YES' if you have a 486-66Mhz
or faster.

Run 'IPDEMO' to configure soundcard
and play.

----------------------------------------

Trouble Shooting

In a minority of cases, Interpose may
not run after installation. The main
areas in which you are likely to
experience problems are not having
enough free memory to run the game and
the sound driver system. You may also
find that the game runs, but not at the
proper speed.

1. Memory problems

You need 6.2MB free memory to run the
game, this requires that you have 8MB
installed in your computer.

If the game tells you that there is not
enough free memory, you need to free
some memory which is being used
elsewhere by other programs. It's most
likely that a cache program, like
smartdrv.exe, is occupying some
megabytes. To free memory used by
smartdrv.exe you must edit autoexec.bat,
and include a parameter like this:

smartdrv 512

Boot your computer again, and run the
game.

2. Sound system problems

Generally, sound related problems will
manifest themselves as the sound not
playing, the sound stopping for no
apparent reason during play or in the
worst case the game will crash.

Dealing with the worst problem first, if
the game is crashing then it is highly
likely that the soundcard's DMA setting
is incorrect. Run setsound and through
trial and error select the other
available DMA settings one at a time and
try running the game with them.

If the game runs but there is no sound
playing, the likely cause is an
incorrect soundcard base port address.
The sound will not play because the game
doesn't know where to find the soundcard
in the machine. Try using the other
settings and re-running the game to see
if this solves the problem.

Lastly, if you find that the in-game
sound suddenly stops and does not
recover, then the problem is likely to
be an incorrect soundcard IRQ setting.
Again, run setsound and through trial
and error try running the game using
some of the other settings available.
If your initial IRQ setting was 7, try a
setting of 5 before trying any of the
others.

3. Game speed issues

You may find that when playing the game
it will slow down in odd places. This
will be due to your machine not being
able to cope with the game configuration
you have selected, i.e. your machine
does not really have the power to do
what you are asking of it.

There are two possibilities for dealing
with slowdowns:

(a) Change the music quality.
If the game slow down on a few occasions
only, then you can try changing the
music quality (run 'setsound' to do
this).

(b) Change the graphics quality.
High quality requires a fast graphics
card and at least a 486-66Mhz. If
experience frequent slowdowns, then
change the quality in the options to
Medium or Low.
