*************************************************************************              

                             THE CATACOMB ABYSS (TM)

     The jewel of the GAMER'S EDGE collection of games.  THE CATACOMB ABYSS is 
     the first of a three-part series of 3-D fantasy adventures using the 3-D 
     graphics game engine developed for GAMER'S EDGE by ID Software.  
     Featuring among the very best graphics and animations available on the 
     market today, THE CATACOMB ABYSS will startle you with its rich array of 
     monsters and scenarios that will keep you riveted for many, many hours!
     
     You are the mighty wizard who has been called upon to perform feats of 
     magic and courage against the workings of your arch-rival, Nemesis.  
     Your quest will lead you into the dark realms of the underworld where you 
     will discover a myriad of bizzare and intriguing creatures set against 
     you.  Armed with your wit and the power to hurl powerful magic weapons at 
     your opponents, you embark on an unforgettable adventure into the 
     3-D realm of the Abyss.


                           THE CATACOMB ARMAGEDDON (TM)

     You faced the challenge of your arch rival known as "Nemesis" in 
     THE CATACOMB ABYSS.  From deep below the foundations of his supposed 
     crypt he hurled his powerful dark forces against you. But you prevailed!
     The beasts and creatures which were arrayed against you fell to the power 
     of your intelligence and the force of your mighty magic. In apparent 
     retreat, Nemesis has taken refuge beyond the walls of the Towne of 
     Morbidity, re-establishing his rule over the forces of Evil.

     You are the wizard of renown who once again has been called upon to enter 
     the domain of Nemesis and put a stop to his wicked ways!  You begin your 
     quest in The Towne of Morbidity, a dark and foreboding place long 
     abandoned by its beleagured citizens, replaced by denizens of wrought 
     magic and shadowy spells. It is believed that beyond the fallen walls of 
     the towne lies the Dark Forest which protects entry into the Lost City 
     of the Damned.  Many brave but careless adventurers have fallen prey to 
     the mysterious creatures that inhabit those perilous haunts. Somewhere 
     beyond the Lost City you might find the legendary Temple of Vipers, the 
     seductive-but-deadly Lair of the Succubus, and many other terrible places 
     too numerous to recount.  


                           THE CATACOMB APOCALYPSE (TM)

     The exciting conclusion to the widely popular Catacomb Adventure Trilogy, 
     THE CATACOMB APOCALYPSE will thrust you headlong into a final conflict 
     with your arch rival Nemesis!  But, this time Nemesis has something 
     especially wicked up his sleeve.  No, not a "Dan Quayle for President" 
     tatoo, but something even more dreadful!

     This time Nemesis has summoned fiends from the dark regions of the end 
     of time... robots, cyborgs, automatons... bizarre bio-mechanical creatures 
     engineered to fulfill one objective---your destruction!  These beasts 
     from the future have joined forces with Nemesis and all of the other 
     fantasy creatures you might expect in the deep aybss of the Catacombs of 
     Despair.  Should you be intimidated by this fearful quest?  Yes. Should 
     you shy away from this final challenge?  NO WAY!
