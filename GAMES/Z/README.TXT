Welcome to the Z demo from The Bitmap Brothers
Z (c) The Bitmap Brothers 1996

Installation Instructions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DOS USERS

To set up your sound card, type SETSOUND from the DOS prompt in the directory
where you installed the demo.  We strongly recommend that you use the
menu items within SETSOUND to test your choices.

Z incorporates a system called UniVBE which makes video cards compatible with
VESA Video BIOS Extensions.  This can solve display problems in SVGA mode
and can provide performance improvements on many cards. However UniVBE can
cause instability with some cards.
Its installation defaults to AUTOMATIC which means it will only
install on cards with a VESA standard of less than 1.2  If you wish to
change your settings type SETVIDEO from the DOS prompt in the directory
where you installed the demo.

WINDOWS 95 USERS

Run the SETUP program that is in the directory where you installed the
demo.  This will set up icons for the actual demo of Z and for SETSOUND
and SETVIDEO, as detailed above.

After you have done this please run the SETSOUND program to configure your
sound card.

Please note that the demo will not run under Windows 3.x  Please quit
to DOS to install and run the demo.

IMPORTANT
---------

If, after trying to run the Z demo, you get an error message
informing you of a CRITICAL FILE MISSING, the chances are you
have unzipped the game without recreating the correct directory
structure.

YOU MUST USE THE -d OPTION WHEN USING PKUNZIP ON *EVERY* ZIP
FILE.

e.g.

pkunzip -d a_zdemo1.zip


If you have problems with video modes, especially in SVGA, try
running SETVIDEO.

If you have problems with the Audio, try running SETSOUND.
