You may also start the demo with the following switches (just like the
"INDYCAR -H <ENTER>" above.

-h (runs IndyCar Racing II in high-resolution SVGA graphics)

How to Setup the Controls
 
From the Main Menu, use the keyboard arrow keys to scroll down to the
OPTIONS menu and press <enter>. 
Choose the CONTROLS menu and press <enter>.

Choose CALIBRATE JOYSTICK-1, if you were not asked to do so when
you started the game.  Move the joystick forward, backward, left and 
right, release it, then press <ENTER>.

Choose SET CONTROLS and press <enter>.  You will notice a list of
functions that can be assigned to your controller.  Highlight an option 
and press <ENTER>.  Assign the control by moving your joystick, pressing 
a joystick button, or pressing a keyboard key.  The menu will return.
Repeat for all controls.

The number of functions that you will be able to assign to the joystick 
is limited to the type of controller you are using.  If you are using a 
standard 2-button joystick then we would suggest that you set one of the 
buttons to ACCELERATION and the other button to BRAKING.  The STEERING 
should be assigned to the LEFT/RIGHT or X-AXIS movement on the joystick.  
For REVERSE we suggest simply pulling the joystick back.

Start Racing

Once you are in the game and have set up your controls you will most
likely want to start racing.  The demo release contains the SINGLE RACE 
and PRESEASON TESTING modes. You can choose these modes at the main menu.

The demo is limited to the ARCADE damage setting and cannot be changed.

Spin Recovery: The spin recovery feature is on by default. You can turn
this feature off in the DRIVING AIDS menu.

Driving Views:  You can cycle through different views of the car while
driving by pressing the F10 key.

Information Boxes : Additional information boxes may be called up by use
of the following function keys:

F1     Lap Information - Useful info about position and laps completed.
F2     Standings - up-to-date race standings.
F3     Fuels - Shows current fuel and estimated laps.
F4     Tires - Shows tire temperature.
F5     Tires - This box shows tire pressure and condition.  Space to
       toggle through tires.
F7     Wings - Too much drag at Michigan?  Tell your pit crew to lower
       those wings.
F8     Wheel Stagger - Tell your pit crew how to stagger your tires.
F9     Pit radio - Know what your pit crew is planning at a glance.

NOTE: The demo does not allow you to change your settings from the F-key
boxes. This feature is enabled in the full version.

Graphics:  Graphics and Textures can be turned on and off by pressing
the 1-9 number keys while driving. These may also be adjusted from the
OPTIONS/GRAPHICS menu.  Turning off graphics will increase your frame 
rate significantly.

Pitting:  Pitting is not enabled in the demo.

Troubleshooting:

If the highlight on the menu scrolls up or down by itself, you will need 
to calibrate your joystick. At the main menu, press the "J" key to turn 
the joystick off.  Then select OPTIONS/CONTROLS/CALIBRATE JOYSTICK #1.  
Follow instructions above for calibrating.

AWE 32: If you are using an AWE 32 you may encounter problems with the
autodetect sound installation.  If this should happen, reboot and use
manual setup.

Memory Issues: If you have trouble setting up your sound during install,
use the Create Boot Disk option from the setup menu and boot from that
disk. If you encounter problems creating a boot disk from Windows95,
restart in MS-DOS mode and run the setup again.

Graphics Problems: If you are having graphics problems, try installing
the UNIVBE driver from the setup menu. Due to differences in video cards
across systems, you may also attain increased graphics performance by
not installing the UNIVBE driver from your system.   

To improve frame rate:
1.  Run in VGA mode.
2.  Reduce the number of opponents you race against in the 
    OPTIONS/OPPONENTS menu.
3.  Reduce the number of opponents seen and heard in the OPTIONS/OPPONENTS    
    menu.
4.  Turn off graphics options in the OPTIONS/GRAPHICS menu.
5.  Start the game by typing  INDYCAR -F <enter> to use FM sound.
6.  Make sure your TURBO button is on (if your computer has one.)
