Now with Amigaball, still 256 bytes!

I took the existing freedos version (no music, 231 bytes)
codegolfed it down to ~210 bytes, and included a quick
impression of the famous AmigaBall to fill the rest of the space

This version is for decent hardware and widescreen (~16:9)
the AmigaBall will not look "round" on 4:3 screens, there
is an alternative version for 4:3 screens in the archive.

The capture is done with OBS and DOSBOX, so the tunnel
slows down a bit for various reasons, it is smooth as silk
on real hardware though :)

Thanks to "frag"/fsqrt and "FUZxxl" for saving some bytes!
