Roadwarrior runs in a 640x400 VESA mode. Some video cards need to run a

resolution automatically on startup for cards without support for
640x400, however for optimum performance 640x400 is recomended.

try using the Soundblaster PRO setting. Other sounblaster choices may work 
as well.

HINTS & TIPS

Keep your vehicles speed under control. Tapping the accelerator is
the best way to maintain a comfortable speed in Roadwarrior, of course
decelerate for the corners, with a little practice you will learn the
optimum speed for any given situation without losing control on the
corners. learn to anticipate the corners and react to them well in
advance. Remember the Hover Vehicles in RW are capable of turning on a
dime, so anticipate a possible last minute turn from your quarry.

Don't shoot at everything in the game! Ammuntion and Time are limited,
use your 'T' key (TARGETING) to choose the next relevent target, seek
that target out as fast as possible and SMOKE IT! The best skill in
Roadwarrior to develop is tenatious driving habits, learn to avoid the
hazards and enemies that block the path to your objective.

On the mission map screen, after carefully reviewing the mission
objectives, take a moment to look at some of the enemies. You can cycle
through them with the left and right arrow keys. Also it is important
to remember that when you exit the map your WAYFINDER will be locked
on to the last thing selected by your arrow keys. Of course once on
the mission you can use your 'T' key to set your wayfinder on a new
target.

Ramming and disrupting a vehicle is a good way to buy some time time
and slow it up so you can nail it with some weapons. Also the act of
ramming does damage as well.

Fire missiles carefully as certain types have a 'recycle' time until
their ready for the next shot.

Experiment with the diferent views for different situations. For example
the full screen 'bumper view'is great for airborne threats.

Don't follow your wayfinder literally. If it is pointing to say NORTH-EAST
but your target is 4 KM away you can continue to travel north and east at
your discretion. Only when you are very CLOSE to your target should you
choose to follow the wayfinder exactly.
