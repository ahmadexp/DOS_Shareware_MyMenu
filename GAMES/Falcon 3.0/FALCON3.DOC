Falcon 3.0 Demo - Spectrum HoloByte

ABOUT THE DEMO
Falcon 3.0 is the most complete combat flight simulator ever created.
Modeled after the F-16 Fighting Falcon, Falcon 3.0 continues the long line
of quality flight simulators brought to you by Spectrum HoloByte. The demo
version of Falcon 3.0 gives you a taste of dogfighting action with the
spirit of modern aerial combat. This demo is a pre-release, limited version
of the actual program, so there may be some modifications, corrections and
additions made to the final released version.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The Falcon 3.0 demo requires an IBM AT or compatible (8 MHz 80286 minimum)
with at least 640K RAM and VGA graphics. You must have 560K free RAM in
order to run this demo. If you don't have 560K free RAM, disable any ram-
resident programs (mouse drivers, virus checkers, etc.) and then reboot
your computer. Sound can be played through either the internal speaker, an
Ad Lib sound card or SoundBlaster sound card. See the LOADING section for
more instructions.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE
The demo version of Falcon 3.0 is an interactive demo. This means that you
will be able to fly around in the simulation. Due to space limitations and
other constraints, this demo is by no means a complete game. Many of the
functions have been removed in order to save space and to simplify game
play.

About Falcon 3.0...
-------------------
The object of the demo version of Falcon 3.0 is to fly around the world and
destroy any enemy plane you encounter. Any ground targets you find are
enemy forces, so fire at will. Your game will end after about 10 minutes
(when your fuel runs out) or if you are shot down. Keep a careful eye on
your wingman; he's out there to help save your hide. So, power up, happy
hunting and check six for that MiG-29. He's a killer.

Introduction screens:
--------------------
After you load the program, there will be a couple of introduction screens
with basic information on the game. After these screens have passed by
there will be an animation sequence. You can press any key to bypass each
screen as it appears, or Esc to skip all screens. Once the animation has
finished, you will be in the cockpit.

Flight controls:
---------------
Following are the keys you need to control your F-16's flight:

J, left arrow    Bank left
L, right arrow   Bank right
I, up arrow      Nose down
M, down arrow    Pull up

These control keys are duplicated on the numeric keypad as well with the 4,
6, 8 and 2 keys respectively.

The following keys control your acceleration:

+  Increase throttle
-  Decrease throttle
/  Afterburner/Military power toggle
>  Increase afterburner stage
<  Decrease afterburner stage

It is to your advantage not to fly in afterburner while dogfighting because
of the tendency to overshoot your target. Use afterburner only to increase
to combat speed or to evade an enemy plane.

Weapon selection and firing:
---------------------------
Following are the keys to select and fire your weapons:

Enter     Select air-to-air weapons
Backspace Select air-to-ground weapons
Spacebar  Fire selected weapon
T         Select new target (air-to-air or air-to-ground)

When you hear a high pitched tone, your missile has locked onto a target.
This is the best time to fire your air-to-air missiles.

On the joystick, one button controls weapons firing while the other toggles
through the various air-to-air weapons.

Front cockpit and displays:
--------------------------
There are a number of items that are in your front cockpit field of view.
These are graphically represented below (see the corresponding number for
information on that item):

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

1.  Head Up Display (HUD). This is the most important display in your
    cockpit. It contains heading, altitude, speed and weapon information
    vital to your survival. During combat, you will be looking here most
    of the time. See the HUD section for more details.
2.  Radar/Electro-Optical display (REO). The REO contains data on
    incoming planes, their speed, altitude and targeting information. If
    there are no targets within range of your radar, this display will
    be blank. See the REO section for more details.
3.  Threat Warning Azimuth Indicator (TWAI). The TWAI shows the direction
    of incoming threats. In this display, your F-16 is located in the
    center of the circle. The upper half of the circle is in front of
    your plane, while the lower half of the circle is behind your plane.
4.  Threat Warning Panel. Two lights can appear on this panel: the Lock-
    on (LCK) light and the Launch (LNH) light. When the LCK light
    appears, it means that an enemy plane has a lock on your F-16. You
    should try evasive maneuvers in an effort to try to shake him. If the
    LNH light appears, it means that the enemy plane has launched a
    missile at your aircraft. You must try evasive maneuvers and dump
    chaff/flares (see numbers 8 and 9 below) to try to shake the missile.
5.  Stores Control Panel (SCP). The SCP displays what weapon system you
    have currently loaded. The number on the first line indicates how
    many of the current weapon you have loaded. (In this demo version,
    you have an unlimited amount of every weapon.) The different air-to-
    air weapons are as follows: AIM9P and AIM9M (Sidewinder), AIM120
    (AMRAAM) and M61 (Internal Gun). The air-to-ground weapons are as
    follows: AGM65B (Maverick) and M61 (Internal Gun).
6.  RPM Gauge. This tells you what percentage of thrust you are applying
    to your engine. When in afterburner mode, this gauge will always read
    at 100%. To find out your true airspeed (TAS), look at the Airspeed
    Scale on the HUD.
7.  Mil/AB Indicator. This indicator shows you whether you are using
    standard engine power (MIL) or afterburner power (AB1 - AB5) to power
    your F-16.
8.  Flare Indicator. This displays the amount of infrared flares you have
    remaining. Flares are used to spoof heat-seeking missiles. (In this
    demo version, you have an unlimited amount of flares.) Hit Insert to
    dispense flares.
9.  Chaff Indicator. This displays the amount of chaff packets you have
    remaining. Chaff are packets of tiny foil strips designed to fool
    radar-guided missiles. (In this demo version, you have an unlimited
    amount of chaff.) Hit Delete to dispense chaff.
10. Aircraft Status Control Panel. There are a number of lights that can
    illuminate on this panel. These are listed below:
    FLAP   This light turns on when you use your flaps to slow down.
    AUTO   When you engage the autopilot, this light will illuminate. If
           there is an enemy nearby, engaging the autopilot will make
           your F-16 track the enemy plane and fire the currently
           selected weapon if it is within firing range.
    WHEEL  This light will turn on if you lower the landing gear (the G
           key).
    BRAKE  If you use the speed brakes for slowing the plane, this light
           will illuminate.

The Head-Up Display (HUD):
-------------------------
The HUD is the most critical piece of equipment on your F-16. Everything
you need to fly is contained on the HUD. Following is the essential items
on the HUD, in clockwise order starting from the upper left hand corner:

      +-------------------+
     / 1        2          \
    +                       +
    |           6           |
    |                       |
    |                       |
    |  5        7        3  |
    |                       |
  +-+                       +-+
  | |                       | |
  | |                       | |
  | |           4           | |
--+-+-----------------------+-+--

1.  G Force Indicator. This indicator is located just above the Airspeed
    scale and measures how many G's you are currently pulling.
2.  Directional Indicator. When there is an enemy plane within radar
    range, a line will appear from this crosshair. This line shows the
    direction to find the enemy plane.
3.  Altitude Scale. This scale is located on the far right hand side of
    the HUD and shows your current altitude in thousands of feet. There
    is a digital display of your altitude in the lower right hand corner
    of the HUD.
4.  Heading Scale. The Heading Scale is located at the bottom of every
    air-to-air HUD (top of every air-to-ground HUD) and displays your
    current direction in tens of degrees. 
5.  Airspeed Scale. This scale is located on the far left hand side of
    the HUD and shows your current airspeed in tens of knots.
6.  Aiming Reticle. In air-to-air missile mode (AIM9P, AIM9M and AIM120),
    this circle in the middle of the HUD will flash when you have a lock
    on an enemy plane. If you fire a missile without this circle
    flashing, you are most likely to miss your target. In air-to-air gun
    mode (M61), there is a "funnel" showing the path of your bullets.
    In air-to-ground missile mode (GBU15 and AGM65B), there will be a
    crosshair to target ground objects. Finally, in air-to-ground gun
    mode (M61), there will be a small reticle to indicate the path of the
    bullets.
7.  Pitch Ladder. These bars, located in the center of your HUD, show you
    whether you are climbing (solid lines) or diving (dashed lines). The
    positive numbers indicate climb rate while the negative numbers
    indicate dive rate.

The Radar/Electro-Optical Display (REO):
---------------------------------------
The REO displays important information about enemy targets. Your F-16 is
considered to be at the bottom center of the REO. Enemy aircraft will
appear from the top of the display and make their way to the bottom. The
closer an enemy plane is to the bottom of the display, the closer he is to
your aircraft. The following information will be displayed on the REO when
an enemy plane comes within the 20 mile range of your radar:

+---------------------+
|    1            2   |
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|                     |
|          3          |
|                     |
|               5     |
|               6     |
|  4            7     |
|                  8  |
+---------------------+

1.  REO Mode. If there are no enemy planes in the vicinity, this will
    read "20 ACM" (Air Combat Mode). When an enemy plane comes within 10
    miles of the forward half of your aircraft, this will change to
    "10 STT" (Single Target Track). The radar has been greatly simplified
    for this demo.
2.  Enemy Altitude. This number indicates the enemy aircraft's altitude
    (in thousands of feet).
3.  Waterline/Horizon Reference. The "W" indicates the position of your
    aircraft relative to the horizon. If the ends of the bar are pointing
    upward, your plane is inverted.
4.  Enemy Bearing/Distance. The first number here shows the bearing of
    the enemy plane relative to the position of your F-16. The second
    number shows the distance to the enemy plane (in miles).
5.  Enemy Heading. This shows what compass direction the enemy plane is
    heading. If you are flying with a heading of 0 degrees and his
    heading is 90 degrees, he is heading due right of you.
6.  Enemy Airspeed. This is the velocity (in knots) of the targeted enemy
    plane.
7.  Intercept Angle. This indicates the angle (in degrees) you need to
    take in order to intercept the enemy plane.
8.  Closure Rate. This number (measured in knots) indicates the rate you
    are gaining or losing on the enemy. A positive number indicates that
    you are closing, while a negative number indicates that the plane is
    moving away.

Views:
-----
There are a number of different views to see the action. The keys and
description of them are listed below:

1   Satellite view. From here, you can view your F-16 as if looking down
    from a satellite.
2   Ground view. This view is the opposite of the Satellite view. Here,
    you are looking at your F-16 from the ground.
3   Front view. This view accesses your HUD and many other important
    instruments.
4   Left view. This view shows some secondary instruments.
5   Right view. This view shows your caution lights and an actual clock!
6   Rear view. This view gives you access to the rear of your plane (your 
    "six").
8   Padlock view. This view gives you 360 degree targeting in a combat
    situation. This will be described in a separate section.
9   Track view. This outside view shows your plane from directly behind
    as if you were holding the plane out on a stick. The plane itself
    will not change direction or move, while the horizon and landscape
    will.
0   Chase view. This outside view is from the perspective of another
    plane "chasing" your F-16.

The following keys can be used in the Satellite, Ground, Track and Chase
plane views:

F1  Zoom in.
F2  Zoom out.
F3  Rotate X axis. (If you hold down the Shift and F3 keys together,
    you can rotate the opposite direction.)
F4  Rotate Y axis. (If you hold down the Shift and F4 keys together,
    you can rotate the opposite direction.)

Padlock view:
------------
This is a 360 degree view that is utilized in air-to-air combat. There are
four main areas on this screen and these are described below:

The upper left hand display shows all the relative information about your 
current target and the status of your aircraft.

TARGET  This is the currently selected target. To switch to the next
        target, press the T key. (To switch to the last selected target,
        press Shift and the T key.)
ALT     This is the current altitude of your F-16.
YAW     This is the amount of yaw (horizontal movement) that your plane
        is incurring.
PITCH   This is the amount of pitch (climb or dive) that your plane is
        incurring.
SPEED   This is your F-16's current airspeed (in knots).

The upper middle display shows where an enemy target is relative to the
front of your F-16. The red box is the current viewing area, while the "+" 
shows the currently selected target. Your objective is to get the red box 
into the lower center of this display (where the small representation of
the HUD is).

The upper right display shows a miniature version of your HUD with a
target locator line in red. It also shows the current horizon line.

The lower large window shows your current eye position. In the padlock
view, your eye is constantly on the current target, regardless of which
direction you are flying.

To use the padlock view, first look at the upper middle display to 
determine where your current view is. Then, look at the upper right display
and follow the locator line until both your target and HUD appear in the
lower window. Then fly as normal until you achieve a lock on and fire a
missile. REMEMBER: Keep your eye on the upper right-hand display for most
of your flying. You won't be confused if you fly according to these
instructions.

The Menu Bar:
------------
Pressing the Esc key brings up the menu bar. From here, you can select
from three menus: File, Control and Options. These are described below:

FILE:
Return to game  This will bring you back to the demo. The Esc key will
                also do this function.
Start over      This will restart your game and bring you back to the
                title screen. Ctrl-R will also restart your game without
                having to come to this menu.
Quit to DOS     This will exit the program to DOS. You can use Ctrl-C to
                exit to DOS without coming to this menu.

CONTROL:
Keyboard        Select this option if you want to fly using the keyboard.
Joystick        This option has two sub-selections: Default and Calibrate.
                If you wish to adjust your joystick, select Calibrate and
                follow the instructions.

OPTIONS:
The three choices on the Options menu have been automatically chosen for
you by the program. These are directly related to the speed of your
computer. If you adjust any of these options, you may decrease the speed
and playability of the demo.

World Detail    There are three options here: High, Medium and Low. Medium
                detail removes the gradient horizon and reduces the amount
                of terrain displayed. Low detail further reduces the amount
                of terrain you can view.
Terrain         There are two options here: On and Off. This simply turns
                the 3-D terrain on or off and otherwise has no influence
                on the World Detail option.
Change Scale    This option will change the size of the aircraft objects in
                the demo. Increasing the scale of the objects will allow
                you to see them better, but may also decrease the speed of
                the demo.
