---------------------------------------------
(a) Summary
- Play single player scenarios of varying 
  map sizes as Orcs or Humans. 
  (note: These scenarios are custom made 
  for this release only.)
- Watch a slide show illustrating some of 
  the features in the full retail version.
- Watch a slide show version of the Intro movie.
- Sample some of the buildings.
- Sample some of the land, sea and air units.
- Harvest all of the resources: Gold, 
  Lumber and Oil.
- See how the new "Fog of war" works.
        
(b) To build a building:
1. Click on a peasant/peon and then click 
on either the BASIC or ADVANCED structures 
icon.
2. Move the cursor over the building icons 
and the required amount of resources will 
appear in the lower right of the game screen. 
3. Select desired building and the cursor 
will change into a rectangle. 
4. The building may be placed in any 
valid terrain type in an area previously 
explored or currently visible.
5. When the cursor square is not entirely 
green, the current location highlighted is 
not valid to build on.  The area of the 
square that flashes red is unbuildable.
6. Click when the cursor square is over 
the desired building location. A peasant 
will then head to that destination to 
begin construction of that building.

(c) How to harvest oil:
1. Construct an Oil tanker from the 
Shipyard.
2. Seek out an oil pool and move the oil 
tanker so that it is on top of or adjacent 
to it.
3. Build an oil platform by clicking on the 
tanker, selecting the BUILD OIL PLATFORM icon 
and then placing it in the desired location.
4. Once the platform is completed, the tanker 
will begin transporting oil back to your 
closest Shipyard or Oil Refinery.
                
(d) Controlling game speed:
Pressing PLUS/MINUS keys will speed up 
and slow down the speed of the game.


---------------------------------------------
        6. What you can build 
---------------------------------------------
Some units and/or buildings require other 
buildings to exist before they can be 
constructed.  An example of this is the 
Elven Archer who needs a Barracks and
a Lumber Mill.  If any of these buildings 
do not exist, then Archers may not be trained 
at the Barracks.

effects editor which allows you to replace 
virtually every sound effect in the game
with whatever you like.

---------------------------------------------
        8. Playing over the Internet
---------------------------------------------

KALI is a utility which simulates an IPX 
network for multiplayer games over the 
Internet.  The unregistered shareware version
of KALI is provided in the subdirectory KALI.

Please note the following:
- KALI runs only under DOS, it does not
  support Windows 95.
- KALI requires a direct connection to the 
  Internet or a SLIP/PPP connection.
- The unregistered version of KALI will allow
  a maximum of 15 minutes of gameplay.  It
  can be registered using the order form
  provided in the file KALI\ORDER.FRM.
- KALI is not a Blizzard product, and we are
  unable to provide support for it.

The following Web and FTP sites are the
official KALI sites:

     http://www.axxis.com/kali
     http://www.kali.net/   (online soon...)

A Win95 version of KALI is almost
completed and will be available at the
above sites.

For more information about KALI, contact 
its author, Jay Cotton (jay@kali.net).



WAR2KALI.EXE is a patch that improves the 
performance of Warcraft II when played over KALI.
It is not necessary or desirable to use this 
patch when playing over a real IPX network or 
over a modem.

KALI game, run WAR2KALI instead of WAR2.  
All players in the game should use this 
patch.

This patch is provided as a free service 
to Internet users.  It is not a supported 
product.  Please do not contact Blizzard 
Technical Support about this patch.  Any

---------------------------------------------
        10. A Final note
---------------------------------------------
This demo will hopefully give you a taste of 
what you can expect by purchasing the full 
retail version.  



---------------------------------------------
        11. TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------------------------
If you are having problems running under 
Windows 95, please shut down to DOS and then 
run Warcraft II from there.  To do this, 
press the start button, select "Shut Down"
and then select "Restart in DOS Mode".
If you are running in Windows NT and the mouse
is caged to the top left of the screen, set
the vidmouse=0 line in your WAR2.INI file to 
vidmouse=2.

If you are using an Ensoniq Soundscape and
are experiencing sound degradation, use the 
Warcraft 2 setup program to set the digital
sound configuration to SoundBlaster.


Modem Init Strings
For best performance you will want to disable
compression and error control on your modem.
Here are some init strings for popular modems
that we have found to work well.

MOST HAYES COMPATIBLES:
    AT &K0 M1 S46=0 &D2 &Q6

US ROBOTICS SPORTSTER:
    CLEAR string set to:AT &F0
    AT &K0 M1 &M0 &D2

INTEL 14.4:
    AT &F\N0\Q0

2400 BAUD MODEMS:
    CLEAR and INIT strings set to ATZ

If your system does not run smoothly during
MODEM or DIRECT LINK play and you are using 
MIDI music, turn music OFF to increase game 
speed.  This is done by setting your MIDI 
Music Volume to 0, or by using the alt-m 
keystroke shortcut.

Since this is the Electronic Demo version
of Warcraft II, the "Enable CD Audio" Option
in the Sound Options Dialog is permanently 
disabled.  A CD Audio soundtrack is 
included with the full retail version of 
Warcraft II.
