What is Threat ?
ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ
     Threat is a shoot em' up game in which you control a security
force soldier. With your friends you must save the human colonists
from attack of creatures.

     Threat is Fragment's first game and it took us nearly a year
to make Threat. ( Don't ask why... )

Troubleshooting :
ﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂﬂ

Q: Keyboard doesn't work.

A: Due to the nature of PC keyboard hardware the keyboard sometimes
   loses keypresses if several keys are pressed simultaneously.
   This can be avoided by selecting certain keys, which don't 'interfere'
   with the others. Use SETUP.EXE to change them. Default keys should work
   fine with most keyboards.

Q: Why ist'n my sound card working ?

A: Check that your sound card is compatible with Adlib (music) and/or
   Sound Blaster (sound effects). Use SETUP.EXE to determine the
   I/O base address of your card ( usually 220h ). If you find any
   bugs in sound system please contact us.

   If you have Gravis Ultrasound use SBOS - Sb driver.

Q: Why I get 'sb reset' message and game slows down?

A: You have chosen a wrong sound configuration in SETUP.EXE.
   Try again using the sb2.0, pro or 16 option.

Q: Why does my machine lock up while starting the game ?

A: You don't have enough memory.
   Threat needs 600,000 bytes to run with sounds and 550,000 bytes
   to run without them.
   - Use a boot disk to start the machine with enough memory.
   - Create AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS which loads as little
     as possible programs into the memory.
   - Load DOS to high memory.
   - Threat doesn't use mouse so leave the mouse driver unloaded.
   - See DOS manual to do all this.

Q: Why don't the episodes 2 and 3 work ?

A: You have to register to get the two final episodes.
   Please see ORDER.EXE and ORDER.FRM !

Q: What does message 'file error' mean ?

A: One or more files are missing. Try to get a new copy of Threat.

Q: Joystick doesn't work

A: Joystick works ONLY during gameplay  and shop, not in menus. Joystick
   must be plugged in Port 1. During startup of Threat the program
   expects that the joystick is in center position. You can adjust
   your joystick by keeping in different position while startup.
