Running Alien Rampage
---------------------
DOS:  To launch Alien Rampage from the DOS Prompt, go to the directory
where you installed Rampage and simply type:

RAMPAGE

then press <ENTER>.


Windows 3+:  Exit Windows completely - don't run it in a Window or from
the Windows MS-DOS prompt, then follow the DOS instructions above.


Windows 95:  To launch Alien Rampage, double-click on the file RAMPAGE.EXE
from Windows Explorer. Depending on your system configuration, this may be
all you need to do to start Rampaging!

However, certain systems may experience difficulties running Alien Rampage
this way. In this case, you can either reboot in MS-DOS mode, or make the
following short-cut:

1.  Using Explorer, right-click and drag the file RAMPAGE.EXE, from the
    game directory, to your desktop. Choose to Create a Shortcut from the
    pop-up menu. You will see an MS-DOS Icon titled "Shortcut to Rampage"
    appear on the desktop.
2.  Right click on the new icon, and from the pop-up menu, choose
    "Properties".  Choose the "Program" tab at the top.
3.  Click on the "Advanced..." button near the bottom.  The "Advanced
    Program Settings" window will appear.
4.  Select the "MS-DOS mode" check box. You can leave the "Warn" box on
    or off. You should also be able to use the current configuration.
5.  Click on "OK" and you are finished!
6.  Double-click the desktop icon to start Rampaging!


Audio Setup
-----------
The first time you run Alien Rampage, you will see the following menu:

     KEYBOARD
     GAMEPAD
     JOYSTICK
     SOUND
     FINISHED

You MUST go into the SOUND menu to set-up your sound card! Select the
type of sound card you have, then press "N" to the question "Modify these
values?" and the sound card should be initialized.

If initialization fails, you either have a different type of sound card,
or will have to modify the values detected for the sound card. To find
the values you need, look in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file for a line like this:

SET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 P330 T6

The "A220" is the address, "I5" is the IRQ, "D1" is the DMA channel,
"H5" is the high DMA channel, "P330" is the port and "T6" is type of
Sound Blaster card you are emulating.

(NOTE: You may not have an "H", "P" or "T" variable in your blaster line.)


8 meg systems and SMRTDRV
-------------------------
It is very unlikely, but still possible that 8 meg systems could
experience sporadic memory problems. If this seems to happen to you,
check your SMARTDRV setting in your AUTOEXEC.BAT and/or CONFIG.SYS
files and make sure it is not over 1024 (1 meg) in size.
