                        Important Mouse Information
                        ---------------------------
   
   
   
   Virtual Pool comes with its own mouse driver built into the game which 
   has been specially designed for use with Virtual Pool.  Although you can 
   use your regular DOS mouse driver, (and that is in fact the default), you 
   will probably experience better perfomance using the built-in mouse driver.

   To switch to the Virtual Pool Mouse Driver, open the main menu by pressing
   ESCape, and select DEVICE SETUP.  The DEVICE menu will then open.  Under
   the heading Mouse, your available options are serial ports 1-4, and DOS
   DRIVER.  Select the proper serial port for your mouse, then select OK and
   press enter.  If you do not know which serial port you mouse is on, you
   can use trial and error, or just leave the mouse set to the default of
   DOS DRIVER.
   
   If you do switch to the Virtual Pool Mouse Driver, you may disable your
   normal mouse driver the next time you start the game to conserve 
   available memory.

   Note that you must have a 100% Microsoft compatible mouse connected to
   a serial port to use the special Virtual Pool Mouse Driver.  If your
   computer is a PS/2 or has a BUS mouse, you must use a DOS Mouse Driver
   when running Virtual Pool.
