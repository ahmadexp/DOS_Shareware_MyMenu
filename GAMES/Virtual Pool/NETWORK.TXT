                   Playing Virtual Pool via Network or Modem
                   ------------------------------------------

  Virtual Pool can be played against another person over a Local Area 
  Network (LAN), a Telephone Modem, or a Null Modem (RS-232).  The connection 
  type is chosen from the DEVICE SETUP menu from within the game.  
  
  The connection procedure for each of these options is described below.



  Local Area Network Connection:
  ------------------------------
  The network connection requires an IPX driver to be installed on each 
  system before Virtual Pool is started.  If your system does not currently 
  have an IPX driver installed, look for a file named IPX.COM in the software 
  supplied with your network card.  Install the IPX driver by typing IPX in 
  the directory containing the IPX.COM file.
