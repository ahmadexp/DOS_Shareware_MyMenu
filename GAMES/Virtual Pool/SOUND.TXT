  Virtual Pool Supports Adlib, Sound Blaster and 100% compatibles and Pro
  Audio Spectrum Sound Cards.  When Virtual Pool is first started, the default
  setting is no sound.  To change this setting, open the Main Menu and select
  Sound Setup.  The Sound Card Menu will then open.  From this menu, specify  
  which sound card is installed in your system and then select OK.  Now go
  back to the Main Pool Menu and select "Preferences."  From the preference
  menu you can turn on or off the sound effects and music as you wish.

  Depending on the type of Sound Card installed on your system, entering
  the wrong sound card in the Sound Card Menu may lock your system.  If
  this happens, switch to the directory containing Virtual Pool and 
  delete the configuration file, POOL.CFG by typing:

        CD \VPOOL      <enter>   (your directory may be different)
        DEL POOL.CFG   <enter>
  
  
  Then run Virtual Pool again and redo your sound card settings from within 
  the game.
