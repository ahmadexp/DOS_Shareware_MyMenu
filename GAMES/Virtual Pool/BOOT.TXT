                         Automatic Boot Disk Maker
                         -------------------------

A BOOT DISK is a floppy disk which has been specially formatted with DOS system 
files.  When you start your computer with a boot disk in Drive A: your normal 
system configuration will be bypassed, and your computer will boot without 
loading any other programs into memory.  

If you are having problems running Virtual Pool due to a lack of memory or for 
other reasons, you may use this program to automatically create a Boot Disk.  
When the boot disk has been created, you will need to exit this program and 
restart your computer with the boot disk in drive A:

Once you have restarted your computer you will either need to manually load 
your DOS mouse driver, or , better yet, set up your mouse from within the game 
by selecting "DEVICE SETUP" from the Main Pool Menu, and then picking the 
proper SERIAL PORT (usually 1 or 2) from the available choices.  

For further information on setting up your mouse, select "Mouse Notes" from 
the Pool Startup Menu.
