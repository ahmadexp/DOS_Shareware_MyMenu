Troubleshooting:

1.) Boot Disk
The Dig demo runs in Protect Mode.  Most computers with 8MB
of RAM will NOT be able to run the demo immediately after exiting 
Microsoft Windows or with Windows-optimized startup files. If you
encounter any problems running the demo, please make a boot disk.  


2.)  If the opening is not smooth, or seems "jerky", make sure you
have disabled or removed any CD-ROM caching programs, such as
SMARTDRIVE.  Also make sure your CD-ROM driver is not caching
as well.  

3.)If you are using MSCDEX, make sure the switch /M: is set to
/M:4.

Technical issues:

1.) ADVANCED GRAVIS ULTRASOUND/MAX/ACE: In order for our native 
Ultrasound driver to work properly, SBOS must not be loaded in 
your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.
 
2.) CRYSTALIZER PLUG AND PLAY:  iMUSE, our sound configuration
utility, will detect this card as a Sound Blaster Pro.  It will
not work properly with this driver, therefore you must choose the
Sound Blaster or Sound Blaster 2.0 diver from the custom setup
menu.

3.) MEDIACHIPS MAD16: iMUSE, our sound configuration utility, will
detect this card as a Sound Blaster Pro.  It will not work
properly with this driver, therefore you must choose the Sound
Blaster or Sound Blaster 2.0 driver from the custom setup menu.

4.) SANYO CRD-254S QUAD-SPEED CD-ROM:  The Dig Demo may crash when 
it is run on this drive.  This issue is expected to be address in 
the final release product.


A note from the Project Leader:

Ok, so the demo looks pretty cool... What's the story?
Well, it's like this.  A very large asteroid enters an unstable 
orbit around Earth.  You, Commander Boston Low, get to lead a 
space shuttle mission to push the asteroid into a stable orbit 
with the help of some explosives.  It works!  But during your 
exploration of this big rock-in-space, you discover a shaft 
leading into the interior. Things are not what they seem:  
the asteroid appears to have been manufactured. You accidently
trigger something and find yourself hurtled through space in a 
faster-than-light spaceship. Now marooned on what seems to be a 
desolate alien world, you now have three tasks.  1) Keep you and 
your crew alive.  2) Find a way home.  3) Learn what you can about
the ruins of what seems to have been a thriving,technologically 
advanced culture.  As the game progresses, the three tasks meld 
into one. Character interaction plays a big part of how problems 
get solved.  One of your crew will become obsessive and greedy, 
while the other will become fiercely independent.  As the person in
charge, you'll have to overcome these problems while sifting through 
the alien relics, looking for a way home.

And yes, you do get to meet the aliens....


What's the game going to be like??
Big.  Fun.  Deep.  Did I mention big?  The demo only scratches 
the surface, and only shows a small portion of the full game.  
There are many discoveries to be made, some very dramatic scenes
with you and your crew, and some interesting interaction with the
wildlife.  We have tried to make a complete world for you to explore
with lots of fun puzzley things to do.  But rather than having a 
passive world, the story is designed to pull at you and draw you 
into the game. Add that to beautiful art and animation, tons of 
puzzles, richly spoken dialogue, and an alluring digital soundtrack
for a total game experience.


The Dig according to Sean...

The Dig will be out this fall. Really. Stop laughing. I'm not 
kidding!  I can promise this because I hold the whip.  Besides,
I don't get a vacation until it's out and people like you start 
buying the game,the novel, the audio-tape drama, the soundtrack CD,
the strategy guide...
