     Revision History
     ----------------

     Revision 1  ( 5/01/88):
       - Original Software Release.

     Revision 2  (11/28/88):
       - Added definable keyboard option.
       - Keyboard definitions can be saved (KEYS.DEF) for future play.
       - High score file (COMIC.HGH) by can be deleted to "clear" high
         scores.
       - Several minor bug fixes.

     Revision 3  ( 2/20/89):
       - Revised player control.  Jumping in cramped areas is now more
         consistent with the "feel" of jumping in open areas.
       - Major bug fixes.  This version contains no known bugs.

     Revision 4  (10/20/89):
       - Limited revisions.  Added joystick feature to get feedback on the
         "feel" of the joystick control for use in future games.
         * Joystick option not yet available on PC XT class machines.

     Revision 5   (7/10/91):
       - Limited revisions again.  Fixed the joystick to work with all PCs.
         I also modified the scoring system to remove 'bonus' points awarded
         when the player falls.  This made beginner's score unnaturally high.

        recover three treasures from the planet Omsoc, which have
        been stolen away and hidden on the remote planet of Tambi.
 
        Your task will not be easy, you will need to gather tools to 
        increase your fighting and defensive capability, navigate 
        dangerous terrain, and avoid or destroy a horde of deadly
        creatures.  It will take all of the Captain's skill and wit 
        to see the treasures returned to Omsoc. 
 
 
II.  Starting the Game 
 
        - This program requires an IBM PC, XT or AT and an EGA display 
          adapter with 256K of video memory.  The program will also
          function with the IBM PS2 line (not Model 30) using VGA.
 
        - Insert the Captain Comic Program Disk in your default disk 
          drive and type 'COMIC'.

    (Move Right Key)| COMIC to the right.
    Joystick Right  |
    ----------------+---------------------------------------------------
    Space Bar       | Makes COMIC jump.  Jumping height is increased
    (Jump Key)      | by the length of time the control is depressed.
    Joystick Button | A certain amount of left/right directional
                    | control is available to COMIC while in the air
                    | by using the left/right movement keys.
    ----------------+---------------------------------------------------
    Insert Key      | After COMIC has gathered at least 1 can of
    (Fireball Key)  | BLASTOLA COLA, this key will allow him to
    Joystick Trigger| fire.  Note that with the addition of every
                    | can of cola, COMIC can have one more fireball
                    | in the air simultaneously.  When he has all five
                    | cans, COMIC's stream of bullets can reach across
                    | the entire playfield.  While the fire key is
                    | depressed, COMIC's weapon energy is decreased.
                    | When the level of energy reaches zero, COMIC
                    | will no longer be able to fire. The weapon
                    | energy level recharges when the fire button
                    | is released.

                    | door and press the control.  The door will slide
                    | open and COMIC will disappear, finding himself
                    | elsewhere...
    ----------------+---------------------------------------------------
    Caps Lock       | When COMIC has possession of the WAND, this
    (Teleport Key)  | key is used to teleport to another place on the
    Joystick Down   | screen.  The teleportation is not random, and
                    | when used properly, can allow COMIC to reach
                    | places on the screen that are normally
                    | inaccessible.

IV.  Game Rules 
 
        COMIC starts the game with 5 lives, and no objects in his 
        inventory.  COMIC uses two different types of energy during 
        battle, weapon energy and shield energy.  Weapon energy is 
        self-charging, and recharges when not in use.  Shield energy 
        can be recharged by picking up extra shields located on the 
        playfield. 
 
        When an enemy comes in contact with COMIC, the shield energy 
        is reduced.  After the shield energy reaches zero, any further 
        contact with an enemy creature will destroy COMIC.  COMIC can 
        also be killed by falling off the bottom of the playfield 
        area of the screen. 
 
        Points are earned by shooting enemy creatures, gathering 
        objects on the planet's surface, and for excess shield units 
        remaining after charging. 
 
        Extra lives are earned at every 50,000 points, by gathering 
        a shield while current shield energy is already at max, and 
        for every treasure collected. 
 
        The game will end after COMIC retrieves all three treasures 
        or when all spare lives are exhausted.  The treasures include 
        rare gems, a sack of rare coins and a jeweled crown. 
 
        The following tools can be found during COMIC's adventure on 
        Tambi: 
 
        SHIELD         - Restores COMIC's shield energy.  Points are 
                         scored for excess shield units. 
 
        BLASTOLA COLA  - Increased COMIC's firing ability.  Up to five 
                         cans of cola can be collected for a shot max 
                         of five fireballs in air simultaneously. 
 
        CORKSCREW      - Makes COMIC fire in a corkscrew type wave 
                         pattern.  This is very useful for destroying 
                         creatures which crawl on the ground below 
                         COMIC's normal line of fire. 
 
        DOOR KEY       - Allows COMIC to open doors found in various 
                         places on Tambi. 
 
        BOOTS          - Increases COMIC's maximum jumping distance. 
                         This is useful in reaching ledges which were 
                         previously too high to jump to. 



        LANTERN        - There are a few places on Tambi which will 
                         appear dark to COMIC without the aid of this 
                         device. 
 
        WAND           - This is certainly the most powerful tool to be 
                         found on Tambi.  Undoubtedly placed on Tambi 
                         by a powerful wizard, the wand gives its 
                         possessor to ability to teleport through walls 
                         and across voids. 
 
 


V. Setting Game Features

        When COMIC finishes his adventure on Tambi, he may record his
        score for posterity.  The file "COMIC.HGH" contains the game's
        ten top scores.  At some point, you may wish to clear these
        scores and start fresh.  This is accomplished by deleting the
        file "COMIC.HGH".

        Although saving your custom key setup is a very useful feature,
        you may wish to return to the default key setup as described in
        this document.  This is done by deleting the file "KEYS.DEF".




VI.  Hints
 
        - The Captain will have travel through 8 distinctly different 
          areas on Tambi.  The tools found and enemy difficulty varies 
          from place to place.  If one approach seems impossible, try 
          another.  Once you discover the best way to traverse on Tambi, 
          the Captain's job will be much easier. 
 
        - When the game starts, the Captain will have a very low offensive 
          capability, and thus firing should be restrained to short range. 
          As COMIC gains in offensive capability, the most effective way to 
          fire will be in short bursts by holding down the FIRE key.  COMIC 
          will not fire any faster by repeatedly pressing the FIRE key. 
 
        - As firing ability grows, try firing simultaneously while at the 
          start of the jump.  This will destroy most of the enemies that are 
          waiting in the wings. 
 
        - Learn where to jump.  Some of the gaps in the ground can be crossed 
          only by leaping, but there are a large number of places where COMIC
          can cross by simply walking over the gap.  Unfortunately, this can 
          only be learned through trial and error.  As a general rule however, 
          for short gaps, COMIC can walk over a one step gap for every step 
          down his destination. 
 
        - Remember it possible to win.  More than that, its possible to win 
          without losing a single life. (It's just not easy.)



Solution to Level I : The Forest
--------------------------------

Objects to be found:  BLASTOLA COLA, SHIELD, KEY

Tactics:  First grab the cola, and start moving to the right.  You won't
          be able to shoot very well, so use firing for defense only.
          When you get to the right edge of the screen, the view will stop
          scrolling.  Keep walking and you'll move on to the next section.
          After getting the shield and the key, you want to exit on the
          SECOND door after the castle. Note that this is the door to the
          RIGHT of the door that is directly under the ledge where you
          found the key.  Press the ALT (Open Door) key when COMIC is
          positioned in front of the door.
