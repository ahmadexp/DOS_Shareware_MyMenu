  [2] No copyright or trademark information may be removed.

  [3] You must not [a] distribute any version of the Program with unauthorized
      changes, such as additional or different levels, or changed characters or
      mazes; or [b] characterize such versions as an "add-on" or "extension" of
      any Apogee product; or [c] distribute any unauthorized third party
      utility designed to alter any Reality Studios game, game level, game
      episode or saved game.

 [B] ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS IF YOU CHARGE:  If your distribution involves a disk
     or other physical medium, you must also:

  [1] Clearly market the Program as shareware, which requires (among other
      things) using "try before you buy" or similar words on packaging for the
      Programs.

  [2] Include "Reality Studios" and the "R-Button" logo (we encourage use of
      the 4 color version) on the cover of the package.

  [3] Include your name, address and phone number on the packaging and in
      any added documentation.  This can be imprinted on the package or may be
      in the form of a label affixed to the box, carton or folder.

  [4] Any description of the Program included in a re-sellers catalog, sales
      brochure, on special packaging or handouts, must include "A Reality
      Studios Game", "Released by Reality Studios" or "Published by Reality
      Studios" if the word count of the description is more than 14 words in
       length.

  [5] Distribute copies only after the programs on newly created master
      diskettes have been thoroughly tested.  Always use high quality media and
      duplication technology.

  [6] Try to sell only the most current version of the Program.

  [7] Although Reality Studios discourage the practice, you may add an
      installation routine if it does not interfere with the proper operation
      or installation of the Program.

  [8] Program updates, recommended descriptions and "screen shots" will be
      provided upon written request.

 [C] ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS FOR BUNDLES, CD-ROMS, AND RACKS: If you wish to
     distribute in a retail location (such as on a rack), or as part of a
     hardware or software bundle, or on CD-ROM, you must get PRIOR signed
     written permission from Reality Studios, which is in Reality Studios'
     discretion and may be subject to royalty or other conditions.

[4] TERM:  Unless terminated for cause, your grants under this VENDOR.DOC
    terminate 30 days after you receive written notice, or such longer period
    as the notice may provide.  Following such termination, you may distribute
    the Program only until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date
    in the notice, or distribution of the copies you have in stock.  Sections
    [2], [5], and [6] survive termination.

[5] LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF REMEDIES: If Reality Studios provide a
    physically defective copy of the Program, Reality Studios will replace it

    CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE PROVIDE ANY OTHER REMEDY FOR DIRECT, INDIRECT,
    SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES ARISING FROM
    IT, INCLUDING SUCH FROM NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR BREACH OF WARRANTY
    OR CONTRACT, EVEN AFTER NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

[6] MISCELLANY

 [A] Since we would be irreparably damaged if Section [3], [4] or [6][D] were
     not specifically enforced, we will be entitled without bond, other
     security or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with
     respect to breaches of such sections, in addition to such other remedies
     as we may have.

 [B] You will hold us, our partners, contractors, employees and agents harmless
     from damage, loss and expense arising directly or indirectly from your
     acts and omissions in copying and distributing the Program, including from
     any installation routine that you may add.

 [C] With respect to every matter arising under this, you consent to the
     exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the courts sitting in Cape Town,
     South Africa, and to service by certified mail, return receipt
     requested, or as otherwise permitted by law.
