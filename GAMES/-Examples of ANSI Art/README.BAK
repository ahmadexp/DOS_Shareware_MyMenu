The Welcome Screen was the first image
presented to a caller when they connected
to a BBS. Sometimes, a user could get
a good idea of what to expect from the 
BBS just by looking at these screens; 
no doubt a sudden disconnect after 
looking at the welcome screen gave the
user's decision to a sysop who was 
watching callers come in. These screens
range from info-filled artworks to simple
logos that were then followed by a request 
for the user's name and password. 
Occasionally ANSI artists would hire 
themselves out for access to these BBS,
 nd would sign their work; others seem to 
have been done by the Sysops themselves. 
The quality goes in all directions here.
