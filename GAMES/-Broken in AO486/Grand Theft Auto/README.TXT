- You start out alone and unloved on the grim streets of Liberty City.
  You work for a fat, sweaty mobster called Bubby.  He will contact you
  at one of the payphones within the city with details of a job.

- To find the payphones, follow the yellow arrow.  Once you've been given
  a mission, the arrow will direct you towards your next goal.

- To answer a payphone, walk over it.

- When you complete a mission, your bonus multiplier will be incremented.
  The more missions you complete, the higher you score.

- The crates scattered around the city contain power ups.  To pick up a
  power up, destroy the crate.

- If you commit a crime, it will be reported to the Police.  The more
  crimes you commit, the more your Police wanted level will go up.

- Explore.  The hundreds of hidden areas and secret power ups to find
  around the city.
