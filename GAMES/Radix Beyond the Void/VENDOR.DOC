DESCRIPTION:

Radix: Into the Void is an intense 3D flying action game developed for the PC
platform.  While playing Radix, you'll fly down the alien-infested tunnels 
of the Theta-2 base, and even deep into the massive alien ship.  You will
also fly into The Void, where unknown terrors await you.  It will take great
persistence and skill to navigate the small assault fighter through the
winding tunnels and corridors to successfully accomplish your mission.
You will undoubtedly encounter heavy alien resistance.

Radix: Beyond the Void has 3 large episodes; with each one consisting of 8
regular missions and a 9th secret mission.  The action is non-stop, with
only short breaks for the mission briefings.  In each mission, you will
have a unique primary objective to accomplish.  These objectives range from
destroying key navigation systems to recon missions.  Before each mission,
you will receive an informative briefing instructing you about key areas of
the upcoming mission that could give you difficulty.  After the briefing is
over, the action begins.

You will require the use of all 7 (4 in shareware) weapon systems, which
you must to find during your missions.  Hazards such as enemy ships, mindless
zombie alien things, missile launchers, crushing floors and ceilings,
steeply sloped tunnels, tractor beams, gravity wells, and more attempt to
prevent your fighter from completing its goal. Your job is to destroy them,
complete your primary objective and make it out alive.  In Radix: Into the
Void, you will fight for the glory of the United Earth Space Alliance and
avenge the deaths of thousands of humans.

Radix also features modem, network, and serial play.  In these multiplayer
games, you can play cooperatively, dogfight, or play Capture the Flag mode.
