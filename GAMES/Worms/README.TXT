        Note...
        -------
        
        Audio quality has been set to 70%, users of faster machines may
        wish to change this to 100% by editing the AUDIO QUALITY value
        in the Audio Options menu!!

        This version of Worms is still not 100% complete and is missing
        some features, notably the Network options, more than 2 player
        options, rope weapons (inc bungee jump!), weapon crates, banana 
        bombs, the incredible explosive sheep, selection from 4 billion 
        random landscapes from 10 intriguing types of scenery,
        complete computer A.I./skill levels and much more besides -
        see the note about the final version at the bottom of this text!

        We hope that you enjoy this demo and that you take time to explore
        the myriad of possibilities and endless enjoyment that the game
        offers.

        We would love to hear your feedback on the game, visit our website
        and drop us mail on our "Teamtalk" page, or Email us directly at

        Demo Speed...
        -------------

        By default, when the game autodetects Soundblaster hardware, it
        selects 15Khz as the audio replay frequency. This could possibly
        slow down the game on some older or less powerful configurations.
        
        You can change/adjust the audio quality via the game options.



        Worms Introduction...
        ---------------------

        Worms is a strategy game with a difference... it appeals to the
        dark side of human nature. Basically you control your four worms
        and are at war with up to 3 other teams. You must try and use the
        weapons at your disposal in the best possible way - or at least to
        the most devastating effect.

        Lots of people will emerge with countless different strategies, but
        the basic strategy is that you must protect your worms whilst 
        causing as much pain to the other team(s) as possible.

        Worms also differs in that it doesn`t take long before people start
        feeling very close to their little pink chums - you start to feel
        for them as they are blown away and you very soon start to exact 
        revenge on rival teams at any attempt to kill your beloved team.

        Worms is a game that you simply must play - the PC has been party
        to many visually stunning, yet unsatisfying genres over the last 2
        or 3 years. Here is a game that reeks of gameplay - we hope that
        you`ll spend a little time getting to know it and that by the time
        the much more enhanced and option laiden full game comes out, that
        you`ll be absolutely itching for more.

        Worms. How hard is your worm?


        Gameplay
        --------

        Each player enters their team names and worm-names (in the final
        game these will be able to be selected from pre-created teams) and
        the battle begins. 

        A new landscape is created which can be on a variety of backdrops
        which effect gravity, amount of wind, friction and skid potential.

        The worms are then placed on the landscape and battle commences.

        Players have a varied arsenal of weapons (cut down in the demo),
        some of which are limited to a specific number therby increasing
        the strategic use of them and some are available constantly.

        Each player has a limited time in which to move and make fire 
        (in the demo this is 60 seconds) and after they select their move,
        the next player has their go. Because it is turn based, a lot of
        the strategy is very visual which gives other teams clues and 
        ways to plan out their action - but very often just plain old all
        out war ensues!

        Worms lose energy when they are hit and have 100 energy points when
        they start the game. Different weapons and effects inflict different
        injuries and deduct different points. When they lose all their energy 
        points, they blow themselves up, taking any nearby weak worms with
        them (a strategy in itself). They are killed instantly when they 
        drown (or burn in the lava of hell!) or are thrown off the left/right
        extremities of the screen.


        Loading And Configuration
        -------------------------
        Worms will auto-detect your sound card and will function fine with 
        100% compatable Soundblaster Series cards. The quality of the audio
        playback can be changed from the options as top quality playback 
        can effect the performance of the game on slower configurations.

        The game is also compatable with Gravis Ultrasound and will squeeze
        the music and effects (quite extensive) into the available memory on
        the card. 1Mb is recommended although it will function on 512K cards.

        Worms will automatically detect your mouse and graphics card.
        

        Demo Limitations
        ----------------
        Due to this being a pre-release demo, the game has been cut down in
        order to give you a good enough feel of the games tremendous 
        character and hopefully encourage you to want to purchase the full
        version when released.

        This demo is limited to 2 teams of worms, 2 landscapes out of 
        4.3 Billion, 10 minutes of matchtime over 1 round with 60 seconds
        per worm. The Sheep, Bungee, Batrope, Banana Bombs and Crates 
        are missing from the demo. For a full list of the finished games
        features, see the end of this document.

        Menus
        -----
        The main menu offers the following options;
                        
        PLAY GAME       (We recommend you enter team names/worms first)
        TEAM ENTRY      (Enter your name and the names of your worms)    
        GAME OPTIONS    (Only Audio Quality is changeable in the demo)
        EXIT            (Exit game)

        
        PLAY GAME MENU
        --------------
        From here, you must select the teams to play the match. In the demo
        you can only click on the two listed, defaulted as PLAYER1/PLAYER2
        unless you entered a team name of your own.

        Once highlighted, simply click on START to play. 

        
        TEAM ENTRY MENU
        ---------------
        Click on a team name to edit it and the worms within the team.
        Shift + Insert will clear any specific line. In the finished version
        you`ll be able to save your teams and re-load them later along with
        their stats and view their performance in the overall ranking table.


        GAME CONTROLS
        -------------
        In the game, there are basic and extended controls. 

                Basic Controls
                --------------
                Use the left and right cursors to move the worm across the
                landscape. Press enter to make your worm jump. You can keep
                moving whilst the clock (bottom left) is still going. When
                you select and fire your weapon, or the time runs out, your
                move ends.

                When you select a weapon with a cross-hair (for aiming) then
                you can use the cursor up and down keys for controlling the
                direction you will fire in.

                Space fires the weapon, or in some cases, the mouse button if
                the weapon is controlled by the mouse. (See specific weapons)

                You can view the landscape by moving the mouse around, "C"
                centres back on the current Worm if you get lost. The Worm
                team names can be toggled by DEL which moves through all on,
                your team only, all off and back on again.

                The weapons are accessed in 2 ways, either keyboard F Key
                shortcuts or via a bar of icons. The icons are brought up 
                by subsequent right mouse button clicks and the left button
                selects the weapon. It is for you to decide which you find
                easiest to use.

                Extended Controls
                -----------------

                                direct hit is score. It is affected by
                                Wind and gravity (take note of the wind before
                                firing) and you hold space down to fire, to
                                set the amount of power in the shot.

                Homing Missile  [Shortcut F1 twice]

                                Limited to 2, more can be gained via the
                                weapon crates which fall in the final version
                                To aim, you set the direction of the cross
                                hair, then click with the left mouse button
                                where you would like the missile to go.
                                Hold space for power and fire away. Can take
                                up to 50 pts damage from a worm.

                Shotgun         [Shortcut F2]

                                The Shotgun is unique in that you effectively
                                get 2 goes with it. Each blast of the gun
                                can cause up to 25 pts damage and is useful
                                for picking off weak worms at the end of 
                                the round. Aim using the crosshair and press
                                space to fire. Not affected by wind. You can
                                move inbetween shots.

                Uzi             [Shortcut F2 twice]

                                This powerful machine gun is best used when
                                a worm is against a wall. Just hold space and
                                let rip! Remember to use the cursors to aim!
                                It can do 50 points damage if used right.

                Grenade         [Shortcut F3]

                                This weapon is unaffected by wind and can be
                                used to reach long distance worms. Creates a
                                potential of 50pts damage and is unlimited.
                                Used in the same way as the bazooka.
                                Use 1-5 to set fuse length and +/- to set
                                high or low bounce grenade.

                Cluster Bomb    [Shortcut F3 twice]

                                This weapon is limited (5 initially) and used
                                in the same way as a Grenade. On explosion it
                                despatches 5 smaller bombs, each with the
                                potential to cause 25pts damage each. As the
                                grenade, you can set fuse and bounce values. 

                Dragon Punch    [Shortcut F4]

                                This weapon always causes 30 pts damage but
                                is extremely effective in punching other
                                worms off the landscape and into the water or
                                off the screen. The "punch" also destroys 
                                any landscape above. Very useful. Use from
                                closerange.

                Fireball        [Shortcut F4 twice]

                                This weapon is similar to the above but
                                the worm throws a small bolt of energy at
                                the opposing worm, thrusting it more 
                                horizontal than upwards. In most cases it 
                                has the similar result - an opponent in the
                                drink! 30 Pts damage if the worm survives 
                                the fall.

                Dynamite        [Shortcut F5]

                                This immensely powerful weapon can inflict
                                75pts of damage if in immediate range. To
                                drop the dynamite, move up to a worm, press
                                space and get out of the way... you have 5
                                seconds to get somewhere safe. Watch any
                                worms near the dynamite be blown skywards!
                                Initially limited to 1.
                                This weapon is the most powerful in the demo
                                and only weapons such as the Exploding sheep
                                and banana bombs in the full game are more
                                devastatingly effective.

                 Mine           [Shortcut F5 twice]

                                Use these similar to dynamite. Mines will 
                                explode if a worm is near enough, causing
                                50pts damage. You can use mines to block
                                tunnel entrances you may have made.
                                Limited to 2.

                 AirStrike      [Shortcut F6]

                                This weapon drops a cascade of bombs into an
                                area specified by a mouse click. Used at the
                                right time, or on a bridge, it can be
                                devastating! Limited to 1 per game.

                 Teleport       [Shortcut F6 twice]

                                Use one of your 2 teleports to move your
                                worm to safety. Simply click the new place
                                for your worm.

                 Blowtorch      [Shortcut F8]

                                Use this to burrow into the landscape.
                                Select the angle with the cursors and press
                                SPACE to start/stop digging. If you hit an
                                opponent, it will cause 15pts damage.

                 Drill          [Shortcut F8 twice]

                                This weapon will drill into the landscape,
                                press space to dig and space to stop. If you
                                drill onto an opponent, it will cause 15pts
                                damage.

                 Girders        [Shortcut F9]

                                Limited to 5, use these to bridge your way
                                out of holes, or to block opponents or 
                                guide stray bombs. Mice buttons rotate the
                                available shapes, space places the girder
                                onto the landscape.
                 
                 Skip Go        [Shortcut F9 twice]

                                If you don`t want to make a move...

                 Kamikaze       [Shortcut F10]

                                This devastating, yet sad move will result
                                in the worm dying, but usually as a martyr
                                to the cause. Face the worm in the direction
                                of enemy worms and press space... stand back
                                and admire his bravery!

                 Prod           [Shortcut F11]

                                Get close to a worm and simply nudge them 
                                off the edge to their doom!
