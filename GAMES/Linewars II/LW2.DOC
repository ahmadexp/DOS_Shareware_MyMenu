          INTRODUCTION


          Welcome, and thanks for purchasing LineWars II !

          I started developing LineWars II in 1990, just after I had finished
          the original LineWars. At first LineWars II was coded in Turbo
          Pascal with some Turbo Assembler subroutines, and it worked only
          in EGA 640x350 mode with 16 colors. During the years of development
          it was totally rewritten many times until it finally became the
          current SVGA version that is coded 100% in assembly language.

          I had three goals in mind when I developed LineWars II. It had to
          a) feature very realistic 3D graphics, b) run with a high frames-
          per-second rate on fast 386 machines, and c) be as small as
          possible. I have a strong dislike of programs that consume mega-
          bytes of hard disk space and consist of hundred-odd separate files,
          which is why LineWars II contains almost everything it needs in a
          single file, LW2.DAT, which is only a few hundred kilobytes in
          size.

          LineWars II will be my last program to run on 80286 processors.
          Although I was many times tempted to switch to 386-only code,
          I decided it was not quite the time yet to do so. However, since
          LineWars II is targeted to owners of fast 386 and i486 machines,
          it will most likely run too slowly on AT class machines. But it
          WILL run.

          I am something of a computer hardware addict, and thus I included
          support for various new hardware components along the way, most
          notably for S3 Graphical User Interface Accelerator chip, Gravis
          UltraSound sound card and Roland SCC-1 Sound Canvas Card. I have
          not yet seen another game that would use the accelerated features
          of an S3 chip as well as LineWars II does, and also the Roland
          SCC-1 support is far from common in ShareWare games. LineWars II
          also supports SoundBlaster Pro with enhanced stereo sound.

          How to Use This Manual

              I have designed this manual to be more of a reference guide
              than a tutorial. Getting started with LineWars II is very easy,
              especially if you consider yourself an 'advanced user'. You may
              not need to look at this manual at all unless you wish to know
              detailed information about something. Novice users need not
              worry either. If you do not understand some technical detail
              in the manual, you probably don't need the info anyway, and
              thus you may well skip the offending piece.

                                                                 INTRODUCTION
          ___________________________________________________________________


              This manual is divided into four chapters and four
              appendices.  Here's a brief overview of what you'll find
              in each:


              Chapter 1 / LineWars II Features

                   I begin with a short summary of some of LineWars II's
                   main features to give you a taste of what LineWars II
                   is all about.  Start here if you are new to LineWars.


              Chapter 2 / Installation

                   The installation instructions are very simple indeed.
                   You may well skip this chapter if you want.


              Chapter 3 / LineWars II Configuration

                   This chapter describes the many configuration options
                   in detail. You can most likely run LineWars II quite
                   succesfully without reading this chapter, but I do
                   recommend you reading it.


              Chapter 4 / Playing LineWars II

                   This chapter is describes how to start LineWars II,
                   what all the dials and indicators on the cockpit mean,
                   how to control your ship, etc. It is recommended that
                   you read this chapter before playing the game.


              Appendices

                   I have included some helpful tables here, and some
                   information for those who like to know technical details.
                   There are four appendices.

                   Appendix A lists all LineWars II error messages.  Look
                   here if you need an explanation of an error message.

                   Appendix B describes how much memory LineWars II uses
                   in each of the main graphics and sound configurations.
                   Look here if you wish to check if LineWars II will have
                   enough memory on your system or if you receive Out Of
                   Memory errors.

          ___________________________________________________________________


                   Appendix C covers technical information about LineWars II.
                   You probably won't need this information unless you are
                   an advanced user or a programmer yourself.

                   Appendix D describes how you can build a cheap parallel
                   port sound output device which you can use with LineWars
                   II. The parts cost only one or two dollars and the sound
                   quality is not that much worse than with a Sound Blaster,
                   so the Price/Performance ratio is extremely good.


          Registration and Upgrade Information

              If you live in Finland and you have got an unregistered copy
              of LineWars II (downloaded from a BBS, for example), you can
              register and receive the registered version if you send me
              the amount of 100 FIM. Please include your full name and
              address. If you like, you can also tell me what sort of a
              machine you run LineWars II on. And if you have found any
              bugs, I will of course be very interested to hear about them.
              I will send the registered version on a floppy disk within
              a week or two.

              If you live outside Finland, please contact Safari Software

                                             CHAPTER 1 / LINEWARS II FEATURES
          ___________________________________________________________________



          CHAPTER 1 / LINEWARS II FEATURES


          LineWars II is basically a 3-D space arcade game. It requires
          almost no strategical thinking. What makes LineWars II special
          is the use of realtime lightsource-shaded graphics, support for
          high end graphics and sound cards, and the ability to play against
          one or many human opponents.

          In the star systems that you visit in LineWars II there is always
          a sun, a planet and various other objects. All objects are very
          realistically shaded with the light emitted from the sun. When
          you rotate in space you will see that the brightest side of any
          ship is always the one pointed towards the sun. This is what
          lightsource-shaded graphics is all about.

          LineWars II uses vector-based polygon graphics to represent the
          objects in space. The planets are represented with extremely
          optimized Gouraud-shaded balls. The routine to draw a Gouraud-
          shaded ball is one of LineWars II's most unique features. The
          algorithm is totally my own invention, and it uses a thoroughly
          different approach than traditional polygon-mesh representation
          of a ball. (More info can be found in the Appendix C.)

          The registered version of LineWars II contains a demonstration
          game, nine single-play missions, two two-player missions and two
          multi-player missions. Unregistered shareware version has the demo
          game, three first single-play missions and only one two-player and
          one multi-player mission.

          All the missions of LineWars II can be played many times in a
          row. The object of the game is to shoot a lot of enemy ships while
          not getting yourself killed. Your score increments every time you
          kill an enemy ship, and the game keeps track of your highest scores
          in each of the single-play missions. In the two-player and multi-
          player missions your score is based on your victories/deaths ratio,
          and it spans the current session only.

          LineWars II uses your VESA-compatible or S3 Accelerated SVGA card
          much better than most comparable games, and it supports a wide
          variety of sound cards, including Gravis UltraSound and Roland
          SCC-1. And even though it is such a complex and sophisticated
          game, it can run in as little as 80 kilobytes of memory, and even
          on AT class machines.

                                                     CHAPTER 2 / INSTALLATION
          ___________________________________________________________________



          CHAPTER 2 / INSTALLATION


          Actually, since you are reading this, you have already installed
          LineWars II. Installing consists of deciding where to put the
          LineWars II files, and then unarchiving the files there.

          Where To Put LineWars II

              LineWars II is not very picky about the location where it
              sits on your disk. It is recommended that you install it on a
              hard disk, however. It will work without problems even from
              a 360KB floppy disk, but the loading will then be very slow.

              There is no reason why you shouldn't put LineWars II onto a
              Stacked or DoubleSpaced disk partition. However, since the
              LW2U.DAT file is already very tightly compressed, it will
              not compress any further on a compressed disk partition.

          Unarchiving The Files

              You may have gotten LineWars II from various sources, and
              the method how LineWars II is archived will vary. If you
              got LineWars II on a diskette, it most likely included an
              INSTALL program which did the unarchiving for you.

              Other possible distribution archives are ZIP and LZH files.
              They are unarchived with commands 'PKUNZIP FILENAME.ZIP' and
              'LHA E FILENAME.LZH', respectively. LineWars II archive does
              not contain subdirectories, so you do not have to worry with
              giving certain flags to the unarchive commands.

          After you have unarchived LineWars II, you are ready to start
          playing it. However, I STRONGLY recommend that you first take
          some time to check the various configuration options (see the
          next chapter) LineWars II has to offer. Selecting the
          configuration that best suits your hardware will make the game
          much more enjoyable.

          CHAPTER 3 / CONFIGURATION


          To get the most out of LineWars II you must configure it for your
          hardware. LineWars II includes a configuration screen with which
          this is accomplished. To get to the configuration screen you have
          two options:

              1) Start LineWars II without any options (that is, write just
                 LW2 at the DOS prompt and press enter) and select the menu
                 option 'Configure LineWars II', or

              2) Start LineWars II with a command LW2 CFG at the DOS
                 prompt (you don't have to use capital letters).

          In the configuration screen you may use cursors or mouse to select
          an option in the menu. Pressing F1 will show help about the current
          menu item. The configuration screen looks somewhat like this:

          ___________________________________________________________________


          The first thing you should do after starting Configuration is to
          select SysInfo. Do this by pressing Enter when the 'SysInfo' text
          on the top menu row is highlighted, or by clicking on this menu
          item with the mouse.


          SysInfo

              When you select 'SysInfo' from the main menu screen, LineWars
              II will attempt to find out the available hardware options.
              To check the hardware LineWars II needs to 'poke around' in
              your computer, and there is a chance some of the checks might
              cause your system to crash. Therefore you should never select
              SysInfo under a multitasker (such as Windows, DESQview or OS/2)
              unless you have saved all your work in other processes.
              The chance of LineWars II SysInfo crashing your system is
              quite small, but it never hurts to be cautious. If your system
              should crash, just do not select SysInfo again in the future.

              The SysInfo screen looks somewhat like this:

                                                    CHAPTER 3 / CONFIGURATION
          ___________________________________________________________________


              The SysInfo screen is divided into several distinct areas.
              The most important of these are 'Display Hardware', 'Control
              Hardware', 'Sound Hardware', and 'Com Ports'. In the bottom
              two boxes you can also see the CPU type and the current
              operating system version.

              The 'Display Hardware' section shows which type of graphics
              card your computer has, the Chipset of the card (if known),
              and how much memory the card has. The information presented
              is not necessarily 100 % accurate, it just displays what
              sort of display hardware LineWars II thinks you have.

              You can use the 'Control Hardware' section to verify that
              LineWars II correctly detects your Joystick and Mouse, if
              you have them.

              The 'Sound Hardware' section is perhaps the most interesting
              of them all. The three 'Covox' ports are not necessarily
              real, since there is no sure way to detect parallel port DAC
              devices. But if you DO have a parallel port DAC device, it
              will be located in one of these Covox addresses. Value 'NONE'
              means that the BIOS thinks the port does not exist.

              The Sound Blaster row gives the Sound Blaster port address, and
              in parenthesis the IRQ line, for example (IRQ 5). If LineWars
              II determined that the card is a Sound Blaster Pro, it will be
              shown as (Pro I5), where the Ix gives the IRQ line number.

              The next row displays Gravis Ultrasound port address and the
              amount of DRAM installed on the card. The last row tells the
              Roland MPU-401 port address, if found. LineWars II tries to
              detect which Roland version you have by looking at the MPU
              firmware revision. If the firmware revision equals that of
              an LAPC-I or an SCC-1, it will be shown in parenthesis.

              The 'COM Ports' section displays your COM port base addresses
              and UART types. The important thing is to check if LineWars II
              correctly detects your NS16550A or IBM Type 3 UARTs, which
              feature a FIFO buffer.

              To exit the SysInfo screen you may press any key or click a
              mouse button. When you select SysInfo and then return from it,
              LineWars II hides the configuration options that are not
              available with your hardware.

          Graphics

              When you highlight the 'Graphics' top menu item, you will be
              presented with the graphics submenu. In this menu you may
              select the graphics mode you wish LineWars II to use, and
              the ambient light value.

              MCGA 320 x 200

                   The MCGA mode is the traditional 256-color mode which is
                   available on every MCGA and VGA card. The graphics are
                   very fast but blocky due to the very low resolution. If
                   you have a very slow machine, an MCGA card, or a non-IBM-
                   compatible VGA card, this is the mode for you.

              VGA  320 x 480

                   This is a non-standard (that is, the BIOS of your display
                   card does not support it) mode, and thus it requires a
                   100 % IBM-compatible VGA or SVGA card. This mode is also
                   quite fast, especially on local bus machines, and it uses
                   the least amount of main memory of all the graphics modes.
                   If you have an IBM-compatible VGA card with only 256 KB of
                   memory, this is the mode for you. Note that it takes a
                   little while for a monitor to settle to this weird mode.

              VESA 640 x 480

                   This is a very nice mode on SVGA cards with at least 512
                   kilobytes of memory, because of the high resolution.
                   However, this mode requires an additional 256 kilobytes of
                   main memory to run, and your SVGA card must either have a
                   VESA-compatible BIOS, or you must load a VESA driver for
                   your SVGA card. Also, since the amount of data to update
                   on the screen is over four times more than with MCGA,
                   this mode requires quite a fast machine with a fast SVGA
                   card and at least a 386 processor.

              S3 Accelerated

                   If you have a Graphics Accelerator SVGA card with an S3
                   chip and with one megabyte of display memory, you are in
                   luck. The S3 mode of LineWars II displays spectacular and
                   fast graphics, and still uses as little main memory as the
                   VGA mode. This mode requires at least a 386 processor.
                   Note that in this mode the screen might seem to slightly
                   'jump' occassionally. This is not a real bug but a feature
                   having to do with the way I use the memory of the card.

              ATI Mach8/Mach32

                   If you have one of the ATI Ultra family of graphics
                   accelerator cards, like ATI Ultra, ATI Ultra+ or ATI
                   Ultra Pro, you are in luck. The ATI mode displays
                   spectacular and fast graphics, and still uses as little
                   main memory as the VGA mode. This mode requires at least
                   a 386 processor and at least one megabyte of display
                   memory.

              GRAPHDRV.LW2

                   If none of the standard LineWars II graphics modes suit
                   your hardware, you need to use a separate add-on graphics
                   driver. This driver needs to be renamed to 'GRAPHDRV.LW2'
                   and it needs to be in the current directory (the directory
                   where you are when you start LW2.EXE) for LineWars II to
                   be able to use it. At the time of this writing there are
                   two add-on drivers available: HERCULES.LW2 and EGA.LW2
                   for Hercules Monochrome and EGA, respectively.

              Ambient Light

                   Ambient Light is a Computer Graphics term which means back-
                   ground light at constant intensity throughout the scene.
                   In LineWars II this controls the brightness of polygons
                   that are in shadow. A very low amount of ambient light
                   would be the most realistic, but it will make the game
                   harder to play, since you will have trouble seeing ships
                   that come directly from the sun.


          Control

              When you highlight the 'Control' top menu item, you will be
              presented with the control submenu. In this menu you may
              select the steering device you wish to use, the scaling
              factors of the device, and keys to use for Laser and Missile.

              Keyboard

                   If you select Keyboard as your steering device, you will
                   use the cursor keys (either on the numeric keypad or the
                   separate inverted-T keys) for steering. The table on the
                   following page shows the steering keys on the keypad:

              Joystick

                   The joystick has two distinct 'modes', which are selected
                   with the second fire button.

                   1) If button 2 is UP (not pressed down):

                        - Horizontal stick position controls left and right
                          turning of the ship.

                        - Vertical stick position controls ship diving and
                          climbing.

                        - Firebutton 1 fires a laser beam.

                   2) If button 2 is DOWN (pressed down):

                        - Horizontal stick position rolls the ship.

                        - Vertical stick position controls the speed of the
                          ship.

                        - Firebutton 1 fires a missile, if any ships are
                          targeted in your crosshairs and you have any
                          missiles left.

                   Note that using a joystick as a steering device will slow
                   the game down slightly. This is because accurately reading
                   the joystick position requires waiting for the joystick
                   to report the current position, and during this waiting
                   no other processing can be done. This means also that
                   Covox and Internal Speaker sound output will be distorted
                   if you use joystick, and if you use a COM port that does
                   not have a FIFO support, it is likely that data loss will
                   occur especially on higher COM port bps rates.

                   LineWars II automatically calibrates the joystick when you
                   start the game. However, for a succesfull calibration the
                   joystick needs to be centered when you start LineWars II.
                   (You may recalibrate the joystick even during the play
                   by pressing F4, though.)

              Mouse

                   Using a mouse as your steering device will make the cross-
                   hairs slide on your screen. However, your lasers and
                   missiles will still be launched directly ahead.

                   The mouse has two distinct 'modes', which are selected
                   with the rightmost mouse button.

                   1) If the rightmost button is UP (not pressed down):

                        - Horizontal mouse position controls left and right
                          turning of the ship.

                        - Vertical mouse position controls ship diving and
                          climbing. You can change the polarity of the
                          controls using the 'Y Scaling' setting, if you
                          feel that the default direction is 'backwards'.

                        - Leftmost mouse button fires a laser beam.

                   2) If the rightmost button is DOWN (pressed down):

                        - Horizontal mouse position rolls the ship.

                        - Vertical mouse position controls the speed of the
                          ship. Move the mouse forward to accelerate, and
                          move the mouse backward to brake.

                        - Leftmost mouse button fires a missile, if any
                          ships are targeted in your crosshairs and you
                          have any missiles left.

              ThrustMaster

                   The best steering device when playing LineWars II is the
                   ThrustMaster Flight Control System.  With it you can
                   control almost everything without touching the keyboard.
                   The controls available when using the ThrustMaster FCS
                   are described on the following page:

                        - Main Joystick
                                - Push forward  Ship dives.
                                - Pull back     Ship rises.
                                - Turn left     Ship turns left.

                                - Turn right    Ship rolls clockwise.

                        - Trigger               Fire a laser beam.

                        - Top thumb button      Launch a missile, if a ship
                                                is currently in crosshairs
                                                and you have missiles left.

                        - Middle button         Toggle between forward and
                                                aft view.

                        - Low button            Teleport to another ship.

                   Note that using a ThrustMaster FCS as a steering device
                   will slow the game down slightly. This is because
                   accurately reading the joystick positions requires
                   waiting for the joystick to report the current position,
                   and during this waiting no other processing can be done.
                   This means also that Covox and Internal Speaker sound
                   output will be distorted if you use ThustMaster FCS,
                   and if you use a COM port that does not have a FIFO
                   support, it is likely that data loss will occur
                   especially on higher COM port bps rates.

                   LineWars II automatically calibrates the ThrustMaster FCS
                   when you start the game. However, for a succesfull
                   calibration the joysticks need to be centered when you
                   start LineWars II. (You may recalibrate the joysticks
                   even during the play by pressing F4, though.)

              X Scaling
              Y Scaling

                   If you find the control device to be too sensitive or
                   not sensitive enough, you can change the sensitivity
                   with these settings. When you select either 'X Scaling'
                   or 'Y Scaling', you will be presented a submenu where
                   you can select the new sensitivity value. The possible

                   options are 0.25, 0.50, 1.00, 2.00 and 4.00. A value of
                   2.00 will make the controls twice as sensitive as the
                   default value of 1.00, for example.

                   The menu has also negative values for the sensitivity.
                   These negative values work just like the positive ones,
                   but they swap the polarity of the control, too. If you
                   originally had to turn the stick left to turn left,
                   and you select X Scaling value of -1.00, you will now
                   have to turn the stick right to turn left.

                   Note that the steering device sensitivity seems to
                   change also if you select a lower or faster Game Speed
                   value. The sensitivity does not actually change, but
                   since the time of the game will run slower or faster,
                   the ship will also turn slower or faster. You should
                   always first select the Game Speed you wish to use, and
                   only then if the sensitivity of the controls still isn't
                   right, change the scaling factors.

              Laser Key
              Missile Key

                   The Laser Key and Missile Key settings let you change
                   the key you wish to use for firing lasers or launching
                   missiles, respectively. Of course, if you use joystick
                   or mouse as your steering device, you need not use either
                   of these keys, so you most likely need not change them.

                   When you select Laser Key or Missile Key, you will see
                   a submenu with the possible keys for the setting. The
                   keys are: Alt, Ctrl, Tab, Caps Lock, Num Lock, Scroll
                   Lock, Keypad X, and Keypad ./. You may select the key
                   that seems the most natural to use. The default keys
                   are Alt for lasers, and Ctrl for missiles. You should
                   not select the same key for both.


          Sound

              The sound menu lets you select all the options conserning
              music and sound effects playing in LineWars II. The menu is
              split into four areas. The topmost area lets you select the
              sound output device. The second area lets you control some
              additional parameters, depending on the sound output device.
              The third area lets you control the sound volume, and the
              bottom area lets you select the song you wish to play in the
              background while you are playing LineWars II.

              No Sound Output

                   The first sound output device is No Sound Output, which
                   means you wish not play any music nor hear any sound
                   effects. This settings uses the least amount of memory,
                   so you may want to use it if you are very low on memory.
                   If none of the other sound options are supported by your
                   hardware and you have not a SOUNDDRV.LW2 for your hard-
                   ware either, you must also choose this option.

              Covox (8-bit DAC)

                   This option will play the music using a parallel port
                   DAC output device (see Appendix D for how to build one
                   yourself). You should also select Port Address and Play
                   Frequency to suit your hardware, and possibly also the
                   Timer Handling setting.

                   Playing sound thru a parallel port DAC device uses quite
                   a lot of CPU power, and it needs 128 kilobytes of memory
                   to store the digitized instrument and effects samples.
                   If you have a slow machine and especially if you use a
                   memory manager like QEMM, you should first try with a
                   very low Play Frequency, and only if it works reliably
                   select a higher playing rate. Note that using a joystick
                   as a control device might cause some distortion to the
                   parallel port DAC sound output.

              Sound Blaster

                   LineWars II will automatically detect whether you have
                   an older Sound Blaster (which has only a mono DAC) or
                   a newer Sound Blaster Pro. If you have a Pro version,
                   LineWars II can play music in "Enhanced Stereo". The
                   word "enhanced" means that unlike traditional MOD-player
                   type programs that support Sound Blaster Pro and play
                   each of the four channels with only either the left or
                   the right channel, LineWars II plays all the four music
                   channels with both the stereo channels. This makes the
                   music much more enjoyable when using headphones.

                   Since LineWars II plays only MOD-type music using the
                   digitized sound, it does not utilize the FM chips on a
                   Sound Blaster. The driver needs 128 kilobytes of memory
                   to store the digitized instrument and effects samples.

                   Make sure the base Port Address is correct, and select
                   the highest Play Frequency that your machine can support

                   to get the best possible sound. Note that the Sound
                   Blaster must use DMA channel 1 for LineWars II to be able
                   to use it.

              Gravis UltraSound

                   LineWars II will load all instrument and sound effects
                   samples to the memory of your Gravis Ultrasound, and thus
                   the driver uses very little main memory. Your UltraSound
                   card needs only have 256 kilobytes of DRAM memory. The
                   samples are only 8-bit, so the UltraSound card is not
                   unfortunately used quite up to it's full potential.
                   However, since the sound playing is handled totally by
                   hardware, this sound driver will have almost no effect
                   on the game speed.

                   Make certain the Port Address is correct. LineWars II
                   tries to detect the port address based on the ULTRASND
                   environment variable, but if it fails you need to set
                   the address yourself.

                   If you have the optional GRAVIS3D.LW2 file, you can
                   make LineWars II play some of the sound effects using
                   Focal Point 3D sound. This gives an enhanced sense of
                   direction to the sounds especially with headphones.

                   Note that you can also use the Sound Blaster sound driver
                   of LineWars II with your Gravis Ultrasound, but only if
                   you have loaded SBOS with the -x2 parameter.

              Roland LAPC-I

                   LineWars II will load new patches to your Roland LAPC-I,
                   MT-32 or compatible synth module when starting. This is
                   why the game will load a bit slowly when using this
                   sound device. However, this driver has almost no effect
                   on the actual game speed.

                   You must have a Roland MPU-401 or compatible Midi
                   Processing Unit on port address 330h for this driver to
                   work (the LAPC-I card includes this unit).

              Roland SCC-1

                   You can use this sound driver also if you have a Roland
                   MPU-401 Midi Processing Unit and any General Midi -
                   compatible synth module. However, the sound effects that
                   LineWars II uses are specific to Roland GS standard and

                   thus may not sound correct on other GM synths. The music
                   will play correctly, though.

                   Make sure you select the correct Port Address, too.

              SOUNDDRV.LW2

                   If none of the standard LineWars II sound drivers suit
                   your hardware, you may want to use a separate add-on
                   sound driver. This driver needs to be renamed to
                   'SOUNDDRV.LW2' and it needs to be in the current
                   directory (the directory where you are when you start
                   LW2.EXE) for LineWars II to be able to use it. At the
                   time of this writing there is available a driver for
                   PC internal speaker, named SPEAKER.LW2.

              Port Address

                   Many of the sound output devices may exist in a variety
                   of I/O port addresses. You can tell LineWars II on which
                   port address your device is with this configuration
                   setting. You should have selected SysInfo before changing
                   the port address, to let LineWars II check the available
                   port addresses that you may select.

              Play Frequency

                   If you play music thru a parallel port DAC or thru a
                   Sound Blaster, you may select the sound mixing speed
                   with this setting. Lower rates will take less CPU time
                   but will generally sound not as good as the higher
                   rates.

              Timer / Stereo / 3D

                   If you have selected Covox (parallel port DAC) output
                   device, you may select if you want the timer interrupt
                   replaced or chained to. Normally you should select the
                   'Replace' option. Only if some TSR programs fails to
                   run correctly, you should select the 'Chain' option.
                   No matter which one you select the DOS clock will be
                   kept on time.

                   If you have selected Sound Blaster output device and you
                   have a Sound Blaster Pro, you may select whether you wish
                   to use Enhanced or Standard stereo mode. Enhanced stereo
                   takes slightly more CPU time, but it will sound nicer
                   when using headphones.

                   If you have select Gravis Ultrasound output device, you
                   can toggle between using Focal Point 3D effect (requires
                   a GRAVIS3D.LW2 file) and standard sound effects.

              Music Volume
              SoundFX Volume

                   You can select the sound output volumes separately for
                   music and sound effects. The volume may range from OFF
                   to 120 %. Note that values over 100 % will overdrive
                   some of the sound devices, which may cause distortion
                   to the sound.


          Comms

              In the Communications submenu you can select the device you
              want to use in the two-player or multi-player missions. You
              may freely skip this submenu if you plan to only play the
              single-player missions.

              To play LineWars II in Duel Mode or Wing Mode requires a COM
              port communications device. To play the Group War or Star Wars
              missions, you must use either a Shared File communications
              device.

              No Comms Device

                   If you select this option, you can only play LineWars II
                   in single-player mode, or you must give all of the COM
                   parameters on command line if you want to use the two-
                   player missions.

              COM Port 1
              COM Port 2
              COM Port 3
              COM Port 4

                   You should select one of these COM ports if you wish to
                   use the two-player missions (Duel Mode and Wing Mode)
                   in LineWars II. Select the port your modem or null-cable
                   is connected to.

                   LineWars II uses the standard base port addresses and
                   IRQ lines for the COM ports. The standard values are:

                              ÚÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄÄÂÄÄÄÄÄ¿
                              ³ Port ³ Base ³ IRQ ³
                              ÃÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄ´
                              ³ COM1 ³ 3F8h ³  4  ³
                              ³ COM2 ³ 2F8h ³  3  ³
                              ³ COM3 ³ 3E8h ³  4  ³
                              ³ COM4 ³ 2E8h ³  3  ³
                              ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÄÁÄÄÄÄÄÙ

                   If your COM port uses a non-standard base port address
                   or IRQ line, you will have to give the correct base port
                   and IRQ line on a command line while starting LineWars II.
                   (See the section on command line parameters for more info
                   about this).

                   After you have selected the correct COM port you should
                   select the line speed, handshaking and FIFO options for
                   the port.

              Shared File

                   If you plan to play LineWars II in multi-player mode and
                   you have a network system that supports file sharing, you
                   can use this communications device.

                   You must also select the directory ("Network Dir") where
                   LineWars II will create the node files that are used for
                   communication between the nodes. This directory must be
                   physically the same location for all the nodes in one
                   game. The recommended location is a RAMdrive on a network
                   server. If your network does not have a dedicated server,
                   you might try using the disk of the slowest computer
                   (if accessing a local disk is faster than accessing a
                   remote disk) or the faster computer (if accessing a
                   remote disk is faster).

                   If you experience problems with this communications
                   device, first make sure that SHARE.EXE is loaded,
                   especially on the server machine. See your DOS manual
                   or online documentation on more info about loading
                   SHARE.EXE.

          ___________________________________________________________________


              Line Speed

                   You can select the connection line speed to suit your
                   modem between 1200 and 115200 bps. Note that the slowest
                   recommended line speed is 9600 bps. Slower lines will
                   work, but the movement of your opponent's ship will be
                   somewhat jerky.

                   If you have a direct cable to another computer, you can
                   select the highest rate of 115200 bps. LineWars II has
                   a very fast COM port routine which will most likely be
                   quite reliable at this speed even on slower machines.

                   You can also select "Use Current", which instructs
                   LineWars II not to change the current line speed of the
                   COM port. This is most usefull when you start LineWars II
                   under a comms program after you have dialed your friend.

              Handshaking

                   LineWars II can use CTS/RTS hardware handshaking to
                   prevent data overrun errors on slower modems. If you
                   use a direct cable connection, you do not need to turn
                   the handshaking on. If you have enabled the handshaking,
                   your modem must be able to receive data (CTS signal must
                   be high) when you start LineWars II.

              FIFO Options

                   If your COM port has NS16550A or IBM Type 3 UART, you
                   can enable the FIFO queue to prevent data loss. This
                   is especially effective if you use a joystick.

                   You can select the FIFO queue length to be either
                   2, 8, 14 or 16 bytes, or you can disable the queue.
                   You have to test which queue length produces the
                   most reliable connection.

              Network Dir

                   If you use the Shared File communications device, you
                   must give the location of the common directory where
                   the node files will be created.

          Gaming

              In the Gaming submenu you can select the default mission (the
              cursor will be positioned on this mission when you start LW2
              without parameters), the virtual speed of the game, and your
              call sign (for two-player and multi-player missions).

              Default Game

                   Demonstration

                   If you select this as the default option, you will see
                   the demo game when you press Enter in the LW2 main menu
                   without making a selection. You may join the battle in
                   the demonstration by first pressing the F3 key.

              Game Speed

                   With the Game Speed setting you can select the virtual

                   speed can be set to be between 50 % and 233 % of the
                   default speed. The speed of the CPU or the framerate
                   does not affect the speed and movements of the ships,
                   it just affects how smoothly the ships move. If you select
                   a high Game Speed setting on a slow computer, the game has
                   to move the ships a long distance between each frame,
                   which will cause jerky movements. A low Game Speed on a
                   fast machine will make the ships move very slowly and
                   smoothly. If your machine is too slow for a certain game
                   speed setting, you will see the FPS indicator flashing a
                   'SLOW' text from time to time.

              Call Sign

                   You can type your call sign, up to 16 characters, which
                   will be used to identify your ships in the two-player
                   and multi-player missions.


          Exit

              Selecting Exit will save the current configuration settings
              into LW2U.DAT and exit from the configuration program. You can
              also perform Exit at any time by pressing Esc. Note that there
              is no way to quit without saving the configuration.

          CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II


          After you have configured LineWars II for your hardware, you are
          ready to start playing the game. This chapter describes your
          options for starting the game, the layout of the cockpit of your
          Cobra spaceship, the keys and controls in the game, and finally
          the goal and story of the first missions.


          Starting Without Parameters

              If you start LineWars II without giving any command line
              parameters, you will see the main menu. The main menu screen
              looks somewhat like this:

              The main menu screen displays the version number of your copy
              of Linewars II, the copyright information and the date when
              LineWars II was last compiled (in DD.MM.YYYY format). On both
              sides of the mission menu are some possibly usefull info,
              like contact addresses for Safari Software and me.

                                              CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II
          ___________________________________________________________________


              The menu bar will be positioned on whichever mission you have
              chosen as the default mission in LineWars II Configuration.

              To choose the mission you wish to play (or to configure your
              copy of Linewars II) you can move the menu bar with up and down
              arrow keys, and select the mission with pressing Enter. If you
              wish to quit LineWars II at this point, you can press ESC.

              If you have your mouse driver loaded, you can also select the
              mission by moving the mouse pointer (and thus the menu bar)
              on top of the mission you wish to play and clicking the left
              mouse button. Clicking the right mouse button will quit LW2.

              After you have chosen your mission, LineWars II loads the
              driver overlays and other data from LW2U.DAT and then begins
              to run the intro.

              When you start LineWars II without any command line parameters,
              all the configuration options you have selected are in effect.


          Command Line Parameters

              It is possible to override some of the configuration settings
              you have given in LineWars II Configuration by giving the new
              setting on the command line. If you give any parameters on the
              command line, the main menu is not displayed and LineWars II
              goes directly into the intro screen. There are five distinct
              groups of command line parameters that LineWars II recognizes.
              You can:

                   1) Start the LineWars II Configuration program,

                   2) Select the mission you wish to play,

                   3) Select the graphics mode you wish to use,

                   4) Select the control device you wish to use, and

                   5) Select the COM port options for two-player missions.

              The table on the following page summarizes the command line
              parameters and displays the shortest abbreviations that are
              recognized. Note that you cannot setup the sound options or
              multi-player options on the command line. Use the LineWars II
              configuration to setup these.

              You may give the parameters in either upper or lower case, and
              multiple parameters may be in any order.

              The command line parameters are most usefull when you start
              LineWars II under a comms program. You can configure LineWars
              II as an add-on transfer protocol to your comms program, and
              then create a batch file that tells the current COM port number
              and BPS rate to LineWars II on the command line. When the comms
              program runs the batch file, LineWars II will load and use the
              correct COM port settings.

              Other use for the command line parameters is to automatically
              skip the main menu. If you give the graphics mode on the
              command line, LineWars II works just like if you had given the
              mode in LineWars II Configuration, but skips the menu.

                                              CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II
          ___________________________________________________________________


          The Intro

              When you have selected the mission you wish to play (either
              from the main menu or from the command line), LineWars II
              begins to run the intro. The intro screen displays a looping
              'planet flyby' animation and a scrolling intro text for the
              mission you are about to start.

              You can skip the intro by pressing Enter, and you can quit
              LineWars II at this point by pressing ESC. If you are using
              a joustick or mouse, you can also skip the intro using the
              fire button or the left mouse button.

              Note however that it is not possible to skip the intro when
              using a two-player mission, because in these missions
              LineWars II tries to establish connection to the other
              computer during the intro. The game will start immediately
              after a connection is made.

              The 'planet flyby' animation displays our solar system as
              it would be seen from a comet or a probe flying in a highly
              elliptical orbit. The camera of the probe is constantly
              pointed towards Jupiter. Note that even though the orbits
              of the planets are relatively correct, the sizes of the
              planets and sun are greatly exaggerated.

              It is a good idea to read the scrolling text thru at least
              once, to get an idea of what the mission is all about.


          The Cockpit

              When the mission you have chosen begins, you will be sitting at
              the controls of your spaceship.

              The cockpit consists of several distinct areas. On the top is
              the logo text. The biggest area in the middle is the Main
              Viewer Screen, which is like a window to space. On the left
              and right borders of the Main Viewer are Ship Systems Status
              indicators. The wide area below the Main Viewer and below the
              registration text is for messages received from other friendly
              ships. On the bottom left corner is the Ship Speed Indicator,
              beside which is the Info Screen, which can show various
              information, selected with the F1 key. On the bottom right
              side is the Radar Screen, which includes Ship Class Counters.
              On the bottom middle is the Shield and Armour Status Indicator,
              and on top of it you can see which ship you are currently
              controlling.

              Main Viewer Screen

                   The Main Viewer Screen displays a 3D representation of
                   space either in front of your ship or behind your ship.
                   The F2 key toggles between Fore View and Aft View. You
                   can see which view you are currently using from the
                   ship system status indicator on the left border, beside
                   the big 'Registered Version' or 'Unregistered Shareware
                   Version' text. The status indicator shows either 'Fore'
                   or 'Rear'.

                   On the fore view you have crosshairs which you can use to
                   aim your lasers and target your missiles. Your ship is
                   equipped with a Target Identification Computer, which
                   can display the distance to the object, the speed of the

          ___________________________________________________________________


                   object, the general class of the object and whether it
                   is 'Friend', 'Foe' or 'Other'. This data will be shown
                   if you have an object targeted on your crosshairs and it
                   is near enough. The data might display the CallSign of
                   the ship captain if you play a two-player or multi-player
                   mission.

              Info Screen

                   The Info Screen has four pages which you can select with
                   the F1 key. The first page, which is displayed when you
                   start LineWars II, tells a short description of the
                   mission (in single-player missions), and your scores.
                   In two-player and multi-player missions this screen also
                   has a chat window, where the text you type and the texts
                   other players have typed will be shown. Thus you may chat
                   in the middle of the game.

                   The second page displays help for some keys that can be
                   used in the game.

                   The third page displays a quick reference for how to
                   interpret the 3D radar screen.

                   The fourth page displays the memory status. It shows how
                   much memory LineWars II uses for code, data and stack
                   (this info is mostly for my debugging purposes), how much
                   memory the overlay drivers use, how much additional data
                   memory is used, and how much memory is still free.

              Radar Screen

                   This circular display, divided into two sections, show
                   how much you have to turn to bring a target into your
                   crosshairs. Radar contacts are displayed as dots. A dot
                   in the outermost ring represents a ship behind you. If
                   a dot is in the middle of the inner circle, the ship is
                   directly in front of you.

                   The color of each dot indicates what it is: red is for
                   an enemy ship, blue for a friendly ship, and gray for
                   other objects (like asteroids). The shade of the dot
                   indicates it's range: the brighter the dot, the closer
                   to you it is. If a ship has just shot you, it is shown
                   in bright yellow.

                   In the radar screen are also counters for friendly, enemy
                   and other ships. They show how many ships of each type are

                   in your vicinity. If the number of friendly ships gets to
                   zero, you have lost the battle, and if the number of enemy
                   ships gets to zero, you have obviously won.

              Shield and Armour Status Indicator

                   This indicator displays the status of your fore and aft
                   deflector shields (which protect your ship from lasers)
                   and the armour around your ship (which protect you in
                   collisions and missile hits, and also from lasers if
                   your shields are exhausted). The shield indicators have
                   the words 'Fro' and 'Aft' beside them. Green color means
                   healthy shields and armour, red color means exhausted
                   shields or damaged armour.

                   Your shields recharge when not under fire, but if your
                   armour gets damaged it doesn't regenerate. If the Shield
                   Generator of your ship is damaged, your shields can only
                   charge up to 25 % of their maximum value.

                   If your shields and armour are very low, your ship systems
                   may get damaged under enemy fire.

              Ship Systems Status

                   The Ship System Status indicators are the eight warning
                   lights on the left and right border of your Main Viewer
                   Screen. From top to bottom and left to right, these show
                   the status of your Lasers, Missile Launcher, Shield
                   Generator, Thrusters, Radar System, Communications
                   System, Ship's Hull and Steering Controls. If any of
                   these systems is damaged, the corresponding warning
                   light will show a yellow text on a red background.

                   If your lasers are damaged, they fire only occasionally.
                   If your missile launching system is damaged, you cannot
                   launch missiles. If the shield generator is damaged, your
                   shield will only charge to upo to 25 % of their maximum
                   value. If your thrusters are damaged, the maximum speed
                   of your ship will be 500 km/h. If your radar is damaged,
                   no radar contacts will be shown, but the radar can still
                   detect the number of ships in your vicinity. If your
                   communications system is damaged, you cannot receive
                   messages. If the hull is damaged, the status of your
                   ship is critical, since the next hit that reaches to the
                   hull will rupture it and destroy your ship. Lastly, if
                   the steering controls are damaged, your ship will jerk
                   slightly from side to side.

              Other Indicators

                   Besides the aforementioned groups, there are five more
                   indicators. On the bottom left side is the speed
                   indicator. It shows the current speed of your ship in
                   kilometres per hour.

                   On the right side, below the Main Viewer screen is the
                   missile counter. It shows how many missiles your ship
                   has left.

                   On the bottom right corner is the Frames Per Second
                   counter. It gets updated every second, and it counts how
                   many frames was drawn during the previous second. If
                   your computer is too slow for the game (in the current
                   configuration), the indicator will flash a 'SLOW' text.
                   You should not play the game if this happens a lot, since
                   it means that LineWars II has to skip more than five
                   frames per every frame it draws to stay in real time, so
                   the movement of the ships will be very jerky.

                   Above the FPS indicator is the clock. It shows the
                   current DOS time in HHMM format.

                   Above the Shield and Armour Indicator is an indicator
                   that shows which ship you are currently controlling.
                   You can teleport to another ship at any time during the
                   game with the F3 key. When you teleport, the ship you
                   were controlling will be controlled by the computer, and
                   you will control the ship you just teleported into.


          Controlling Your Ships

              LineWars II is unique in that instead of controlling just one
              ship, as in most other space arcade games, you can control a
              whole fleet of friendly ships (in most of the missions). This
              is accomplished with a feature called 'teleporting'. Since
              you obviously can only control one ship at a time with your
              joystick, mouse or keyboard, you need to be able to quickly
              select a ship that you wish to control in any particular time.

              To 'teleport' from ship to ship, you use the F3 key (or if
              you have a ThrustMaster FCS, the lowest button). When you
              press the key, you are instantly teleported to another ship,
              which you can now control, and the ship you just left is
              given over to the computer.



          ___________________________________________________________________

                                              CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II
          ___________________________________________________________________


              The biggest difference between controlling a ship yourself and
              letting the computer to control the ship, is that the computer
              cannot launch missiles. Since neither the enemy computer-
              controlled ships, nor the friendly computer-controlled ships
              can launch missiles, you have a clear advantage. To make most
              of this advantage, it is often wise to teleport quickly from
              ship to ship and launch all three missiles of the ship to
              different targets.

              The basic steering controls which you can use are as follows:
                   - Dive
                   - Climb
                   - Turn left
                   - Turn right
                   - Rotate counterclockwise
                   - Rotate clockwise
                   - Increase speed
                   - Decrease speed
              The way these controls are activated depends on the steering
              device you have selected. Look at the 'Control' section in the
              'Configuration' chapter for detailed info.

              You have two weapons systems on your ship, lasers and missiles.
              Lasers are most effective against capital ships and asteroids,
              and since they constantly recharge, you have unlimited
              ammunition for them. Against fighters the missiles are more
              effective, however, since the fighters have good deflector
              shielding but only a light armour. All the ships can carry a
              maximum of three missiles only.

              You can launch a missile, if you have any left, when the
              Target Identification Computer data is displayed on your
              crosshairs, for the target you wish to launch the missile to.

              The lasers are always sent directly ahead from your ship,
              and they will hit the nearest target ahead of you. Since the
              deflector shielding of many of the ships reaches a bit
              beyond the physical size of the ship, sometimes the laser
              blast will hit the ship even if it is not aimed quite directly
              towards the ship. It can take quite a few laser hits before
              the target is destroyed, since the deflector shielding of the
              target constantly recharges when the ship is not under fire.


          The Demonstration

              The first 'mission' you can choose is the demonstration game.
              In this mission you don't need to do anything, you can just


          ___________________________________________________________________
          Copyright 1994, Patrick Aalto             LineWars II Manual  /  31

                                              CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II
          ___________________________________________________________________


              watch the computer play against itself. You can study this
              mission to see how the computer plays. Since even the ship you
              are looking from is controlled by the computer, you can easily
              see what sort of tactics the computer uses.

              If you get bored to watch the enemy ships beat your friendly
              ships (although it is not at all certain this will always
              happen), you can 'teleport' into one of your friendly ships
              and control it. Since there are no scoring in this mission,
              you can practice the game leisurely using this mission.

              If you win (all the enemy ships are destroyed) or if you lose
              (all your ships are destroyed), the demonstration will restart.
              Note that if you wish to continue controlling a ship, you must
              'teleport' again after the restart.


          Single Play Missions

              When the single play mission you have selected begins, it will
              start with the easiest difficulty level. This means that with
              a bit of practice you should not have a lot of trouble
              winning the game. ("The Final Battle" may seem a bit hard at
              first, though...)

              In all the single play missions your job is to destroy all the
              enemy ships before either all of your ships (in some of the
              missions), or a certain ship you must protect (in other
              missions) gets destroyed.

              Your score will increase per every destroyed ship, either by
              you or by your computer co-pilots. The score indicator will
              show your current score, the best score your have got within
              this run, and the best score you have ever had on this mission.

              If you win the game, your mission will restart, but this time
              it will be a bit more difficult. Usually this means that there
              are more enemy ships that you must destroy. On some missions
              also the number of friendly ships will increase when the
              difficulty level increases.

              If you lose the game, your current score will get to zero and
              the game will restart from the easiest difficulty level. If
              you get thru all the difficulty levels of a mission, you will
              see a lead-in text to the next mission.

              If you get enough of the game, press ESC and the game will
              exit to the main menu (if you started without command line
              parameters).

          Duel Mode

              To play the duel mode you need to have a modem or a direct
              serial cable connecting two computers. Both players need to
              have a copy of LineWars II on their machines. Before you
              start the duel mode, first use 'LineWars II Configuration'
              to setup the correct COM port, communications speed, hand-
              shaking method, FIFO options, and preferably also CallSign.

              If you use a modem, before you start LineWars II you need
              to call your friend using a communications program. When
              you have connected, exit (or jump to DOS shell from) the
              communications program, and start LineWars II. Select the
              Duel Mode from the main menu, and look at the intro until
              LineWars II has made a connection with the copy running
              at the other machine.

              When the connection is made, the game will begin. You have
              two ships that you can control, and so does your opponent.
              You must shoot the ships of the opponent to win the game.
              No missiles are available in this mission.

              The score page displays the victories and losses of both
              you and your opponent. Naturally you should try to get as
              many victories and as few losses as possible.

              You can also chat while you are playing. The character keys
              you press will be sent to your opponent, and also displayed
              on your screen. Note that the keyboard layout is US, and it
              cannot be changed with language-specific keyboard drivers
              like KEYBUK, KEYBSU etc.

              The game will end if either of the players presses ESC, or
              if the connection is lost.


          Wing Mode

              The Wing Mode is similar to the Duel Mode, but instead of
              fighting against your friend, you will fight with him/her
              against two computer-controlled enemy ships.

              The score page shows the victories/losses ratio of all the
              four ships.

              If either you or your wingman gets destroyed, the game will
              restart.

                                              CHAPTER 4 / PLAYING LINEWARS II
          ___________________________________________________________________


          Group War

              The Group War mission requires that you use a 'Shared File'
              communications device and you use a network. Before you can
              start the mission, you need to configure LineWars II to use
              this communications device. Look at the detailed info in the
              relevant sections in the 'Configuration' chapter.

              When you start the mission, the game will start immediately,
              without any intro. You will have two ships to control, and so
              do all of the other players. One by one the other players (up
              to seven) can pop into the game.

              You need to destroy as many enemy ships as possible to get the
              best score. You can of course try to create alliances, but the
              computer-controlled ships will still attack any ships they can.

              You can also chat while you are playing, but note that the
              messages you receive may seem garbled if more than one person
              transmits at the same time.


          Star Wars

              This mission is similar to the Group War mission, but instead
              of 'all-against-all' battle, all of the human players are on
              the same side, fighting against computer-controlled enemy
              ships.

                                      APPENDIX A / LINEWARS II ERROR MESSAGES
          ___________________________________________________________________



          APPENDIX A / LINEWARS II ERROR MESSAGES


          There are several error messages LineWars II may give in case it
          encounters a problem. Some of these messages may be given by
          LineWars II kernel code, others may be given by an overlay code
          (graphics and sound drivers are overlays, for example). The most
          common error messages are explained here in alphabetical order.


          ATIDRV ERROR: 800x600 mode with 256 colors not available !

              LineWars II could not initiate the accelerated 800x600
              ATI graphics mode. Either you don't have enough display
              memory (a full megabyte is needed), or the BIOS of your
              display card is not compatible with a real ATI card.


          ATIDRV ERROR: ATI driver requires a 386 or better CPU !

              You are attempting to run LineWars II in ATI mode on a
              computer that does not have a 386 or i486 processor.


          ATIDRV ERROR: ATI Mach8 or Mach32 accelerator not found !

              You are attempting to run LineWars II in ATI accelerated
              graphics mode, but you don't have an ATI Graphics Ultra,
              ATI Graphics Ultra+ or ATI Graphics Ultra Pro display
              card.


          BLASTDRV ERROR: Base address differs from BLASTER=Axxx !

              You have given a Sound Blaster base port address which
              differs from that in the 'BLASTER=' environment variable.
              BLASTDRV cannot determine which one is correct and cannot
              continue. Either correct the port address in LineWars II
              Configuration, or fix the 'BLASTER=' environment variable.


          BLASTDRV ERROR: Not enough memory for DMA buffers !

              This message may be given by the Sound Blaster driver,
              if there is not enough free memory to allocate a DMA
              transfer buffer. Try to free more memory, or lower the
              output frequency.

                                      APPENDIX A / LINEWARS II ERROR MESSAGES
          ___________________________________________________________________


          BLASTDRV ERROR: SoundBlaster did not reset !

              This message may be given by the Sound Blaster driver,
              if the Sound Blaster card does not respond to a reset
              command.  This is most likely due to an invalid port
              address.  This may also happen if some badly written
              program has left your Sound Blaster into a mixed-up state.


          BLASTDRV ERROR: Unsupported DMA channel in BLASTER=Dx !

              Sound Blaster driver supports only DMA channel 1, and the
              'BLASTER=' environment variable has a different setting.
              If you want to use LineWars II with Sound Blaster sound,
              you must configure your Sound Blaster for DMA channel 1.


          DUELDRV ERROR: CTS/RTS handshake enabled, but CTS signal is low !

              You have enabled CTS/RTS handshake in LineWars II
              Configuration or from the command line, and the
              ClearToSend (CTS) signal was low when you started
              LineWars II in Duel Mode. LineWars II needs to be
              able to send data immediately when it starts, thus
              the CTS signal must be high (active).


          DUELDRV ERROR: No COM port communications device selected !

              You are attempting to run LineWars II in a two-player mode,
              but you have not selected a COM port. Run the configuration
              and select the required Comms settings.


          Error loading graphics driver code!

              LineWars II kernel could not load the graphics driver
              code from 'LW2.EXE'. This may be due to a corrupt
              LW2.EXE, you may have specified a graphics mode that
              this version of LW2 does not recognize, you may have
              selected to load GRAPHDRV.LW", but there is no such file,
              or there may not be enough memory to load the driver.


          Error loading mission data!

              LineWars II kernel could not load the mission data
              you requested. This may be due to a corrupt LW2.EXE,

              or you may have specified a mission that this version
              of LineWars II does not include, or there may not be
              enough memory to load the driver. Try to free more
              memory before starting LineWars II, and make sure you
              have selected a correct mission.


          Error loading song or instrument data!

              LineWars II kernel could not load song data, instrument
              samples or Roland LAPC-1 timbres from LW2.EXE. This may
              be due to a corrupt LW2.EXE, or there may not be enough
              memory to load the data. Try to free more memory before
              starting LineWars II.


          Error loading sound driver code!

              LineWars II kernel could not load the sound driver
              code from 'LW2.EXE'. This may be due to a corrupt
              LW2.EXE, or you may have specified a sound driver
              that this version of LW2 does not recognize, or there
              may not be enough memory to load the driver. Try to
              free more memory before starting LineWars II, and
              make sure you have selected the correct sound
              driver in LineWars II Configuration.


          Error loading the CFG overlay!

              LineWars II kernel could not load the LineWars II
              Configuration overlay module. This may be due to a
              corrupt LW2.EXE or you may have insufficient free
              memory. Try freeing more memory before starting LW2.


          GroupWar ERROR: No network communications device selected!

              You are attempting to run the Group War mission, but you have
              not select a network communications device. Run the LineWars
              II Configuration and select the required Comms settings.

          ___________________________________________________________________



          GroupWar ERROR ? creating file NODE?.LW2 !

              The Shared File network driver of LineWars II could not
              create a node file for your node on the shared directory.
              Make sure you have write access to the directory, that
              SHARE.EXE is loaded, and that there are no old nodefiles
              left over from some earlier game in the directory.


          LAPCDRV ERROR: MPU-401 interface did not reset !

              This message may be given by the Roland LAPC-I driver,
              if the Roland LAPC-I card does not respond to a reset
              command. This is most likely due to a badly written
              program having left the MPU interface into a mixed-up
              state. Sometimes the problem may go away if you try
              to restart LineWars II a few times.


          LineWars II cannot run on 8088/8086 processors!

              You are attempting to run LineWars II on a computer
              that has only 8088 or 8086 processor. You need to have
              at least an 80186 processor to run LineWars II.


          MCGADRV ERROR: Not enough memory for display buffer !

              The MCGA driver of LineWars II needs 56 kilobytes of
              memory for a viewscreen buffer. This amount of memory
              was not available. You should try to free more memory
              before starting LineWars II in MCGA mode.

              was not available. Your S3 graphics card may have incompatible
              BIOS, or you may not have an S3 accelerated graphics card.


          SCCDRV ERROR: MPU-401 interface did not reset !

              This message may be given by the Roland SCC-1 driver,
              if the Roland SCC-1 card does not respond to a reset
              command. You may have given a wrong MPU base port
              address in LineWars II Configuration, or a badly
              written program may have left the MPU interface into
              a mixed-up state. Sometimes the problem may go away
              if you try to restart LineWars II a few times.


          Sorry, but LineWars II requires DOS 3.0 or better!

              You must have at least DOS version 3.0 if you want to play

              Your SVGA card has some attributes in 640x480x256 mode
              that the VESA driver of LineWars II does not support.
              The VESA driver requires this mode to have 640 bytes
              per scanline and a granularity of 64K. If you can
              provide me (Patrick Aalto) with information about these
              parameters in your SVGA card, I may be able to fix
              the VESA driver to support your SVGA card.


          VESADRV ERROR: VESA 640x480 mode with 256 colors not available !

              The VESA driver determined that VESA mode 101h was not
              available. There may be several reasons for this error
              message: Your SVGA card does not have VESA BIOS extensions,
              you have not loaded a VESA TSR program, or your SVGA card
              may have only 256 kilobytes of display memory. If your
              SVGA card does not have the VESA extensions in BIOS, you
              need to get a separate VESA TSR program and load it
              before you can use LineWars II in VESA mode.

          APPENDIX B / LINEWARS II MEMORY USAGE


          LineWars II is designed to use as little memory as possible.
          However, the memory requirements vary greatly depending on
          graphics and sound options, and also depending on many other
          configuration options. The following table may be used as a
          guideline to determine how much free memory LineWars II will
          need in the main configurations.

          Special memory requirements of some of the drivers are
          described below.

            - MCGA graphics driver requires 56 kilobytes of memory
              for triple-buffering.

            - VESA graphics driver requires 256 kilobytes of memory
              for triple-buffering.

            - Covox sound driver requires 128 kilobytes of memory
              for digitized instrument and sound effects samples.

            - SoundBlaster sound driver requires 128 kilobytes of
              memory for digitized instrument and sound effects
              samples, plus a few kilobytes (depending on playing
              rate) for a DMA transfer buffer.

            - Gravis UltraSound needs temporarily an additional 64K block
              while loading the sample data. This memory will be freed
              after the samples are loaded to GUS RAM. This block is NOT
              included in the table above.

          APPENDIX C / TECHNICAL INFORMATION


          This appendix describes some of the technical aspects behind
          LineWars II.


          Graphics

              LineWars II uses polygon-based 3D graphics. The basic
              algorithms are pretty old, I have not changed them much
              since the original LineWars (which was made in 1989).
              However, I added flat shading to the algorithms, since
              there is always a sun in the game universe. The shading
              value is based on the angle between a polygon surface
              normal vector and a vector from the object to the sun.

              The Gouraud-shaded planet routine uses an algorithm that
              I first thought of in 1991, but at that time I could not
              make it fast enough. In December 1992 I finally was able
              to improve it enough so it runs in real-time. The algorithm
              uses a 3D version of the classic Bresenham circle algorithm
              and linear interpolation to calculate the color of the
              pixels. Using a lot of precalculation I was able to have
              the algorithm require only one addition per pixel, a few
              multiplications per scanline, and one square root per the
              whole planet.

              The palette I use is a very simple one-color scale, which
              makes shading and anti-aliasing very easy. I could not have
              anti-aliasing and Gouraud shading for the planets at the same
              time using a more colorfull palette, since anti-aliasing
              requires a 'full' palette of all colors between any two basic
              colors, and my planet routine requires 128 shades of a basic
              color.

              The MCGA and VESA graphics modes use a 'dirty pixel' approach,
              which means that I have two standard memory buffers, one which
              is used to draw the ships, and other which contains the ships
              of the previous frame. The sizes of these buffers are 256x110
              (28160 bytes) and 512x256 (128KB), respectively. I only update
              those parts of the video RAM that have changed since the last
              frame. The MCGA mode waits for vertical retrace (even though
              it would not have to, but it would be silly to update the
              screen up to 150 times per second), but the VESA mode does
              not. On Pentium machine with a local bus video card the VESA
              mode might therefore run at more than 100 frames per second.

                                           APPENDIX C / TECHNICAL INFORMATION
          ___________________________________________________________________


              In the MCGA graphics mode the vertical polygon boundaries
              are anti-aliased, using a very simple technique. Since the
              X-coordinate must be between 0 and 255, I can use high byte
              of a word register for the integer part and low byte for the
              fractional part of the coordinate, per every scanline of the
              polygon. The fractional part directly gives the amount of
              polygon color (versus the current background color) to use
              on this polygon border pixel.

              The VGA graphics mode uses a tweaked split-screen mode. The
              screen resolution is 320x480, and the upper portion of the
              screen is double-buffered within the VGA memory. The same
              anti-aliasing technique is used in VGA mode as in MCGA mode.
              Since the vertical resolution is much better than in MCGA
              mode, using only horizontal anti-aliasing produces pretty
              good results.

              The S3 and ATI graphics modes use the accelerator functions
              to draw everything else except the Gouraud planet. The planet
              is drawn by directly poking the pixels to the display RAM,
              which is somewhat slow but the only available technique. Both
              modes use a 1024x1024 physical screen even though the display
              is only 800x600. The reamaining area is used to double-buffer
              the graphics. In S3 mode I use split screen (just like in the
              VGA mode) so I don't have to physically copy the hidden buffer
              to the visible area, as I do in the ATI mode.


          Sound

              The music LineWars II plays was originally composed by U4Ia
              as MOD files for the Amiga. I have converted them to a sort
              of 4-track MIDI file format. All of the songs use the same
              instrument sample library, which takes 64 kilobytes. On MIDI
              equipment this library is not loaded since it corresponds to
              the sounds in the synth, and on Gravis Ultrasound this is
              loaded into it's RAM. The samples are 8-bit, and they were
              sampled from a Roland LAPC-I synth at 10480 Hz frequency.

              In addition to the music samples I use another 64K library
              of sound effects samples. There is also a third library for
              Focal Point 3D sounds, which contain two 6-track samples,
              for the Gravis UltraSound. These 3D samples are a laser blast
              (sampled from a Roland SCC-1 at 30kHz frequency) and an
              explosion sound (also from an SCC-1, sampled at about 8kHz).

              The music routine first converts from the MIDI format back
              to a MOD format, if the music is played thru a non-MIDI

              device. The Covox driver uses the timer interrupt to
              mix one byte at a time, but the SoundBlaster driver uses
              DMA to output a full pre-mixed block at a time. The Covox
              and SB drivers use 6 channels, four for music and two for
              sound effects. On a Gravis Ultrasound I use four music
              channels, four simple sound effects channels (for sounds
              that originate within the player's ship), and 12 channels
              for the 3D sounds. The MIDI driver uses five music channels
              and two sound effects channels.


          COM Port Routine

              In Duel Mode and Wing Mode LineWars II uses a COM port for
              the communications. The routine tries to send data at 768
              bytes per second, regardless of the line speed. This means
              that the line speed should be at least 7680 bps for all the
              data to get thru in time. If the BPS rate is less than this,
              some frames need to be skipped, which may cause jerky
              movement of the ships. The full data for one frame takes
              30 bytes, so the data is sent at a speed of about 25 frames
              per second.

              Since the real thruput is only 7680 bps, even slow machines
              can cope with a line speed of 115200 bps quite easily, and
              this is the recommended speed on direct null-modem cables.


          Network Routine

              In Group War or Star Wars missions LineWars II can use a
              shared file for communications. When using a shared file,
              LineWars II writes the data about the current positions of
              the local player ships to a file that corresponds to this
              node once per every frame, and it then reads all the other
              node files to get the data for the other players. To cope
              with the possibly different speeds of the machines, the
              blocks are numbered and LineWars II keeps a 16-slot FIFO
              queue for incoming data.

          Ship Artificial Intelligence

              The computer-controlled ships use a very simple state machine
              to control their movements. I have however tried to make their
              movement algorithms as 'real-like' as possible. The ships
              constantly check their distance to other objects in front of
              them (but not behind them!) to see if they should try to
              avoid any obstacles. They try to slowly go around any obstacle
              they see, but while they are avoiding one obstacle they often
              fail to notice others. I felt that this caused them to move
              very human-like, when concentrating on something you often
              fail to notice something else.

              The ships will attempt to shoot at the enemy ship that is
              nearest the 'optimal' distance of around 5000 metres, and
              in front of them. If the ship gets too near it's target,
              it will accelerate away from the target and start to rotate
              at the same time. If it finds a better target then, it will
              attack this new target.

              The enemy ships do not know which ship is controlled by you
              and which by your wingmen, so they treat every ship the same
              way.


          Overlay Decompressor

              The overlays (drivers, mission datas etc) are all compressed,
              and the internal decompressor of LineWars II unpacks them as
              they are loaded. This is why the .DAT takes only a bit over
              200 kilobytes of disk space, even though it contains about
              500 kilobytes of uncompressed data, in more than 20 separate
              files.

              The decompressor routine is based on the source code of the
              LHA packer by Haruyasu Yoshizaki. It was pretty heavily
              modified to allow the unpacking directly into a memory block
              and to get rid of the unnecessary directory info in a
              standard .LZH file.

          This is the schematics I used to build mine. This is from the
          HARDWARE.DOC file included with ModPlay 2.10 by Mark Cox.
          There exists many different versions of this schematics, but I
          have found this one to be the most reliable and best sounding.

          You need one plug for your amp, one for your parallel port and
          9 pieces of 20k and 9 pieces of 10K resistors.
          Use 1% resistors if possible Ä and 20k sound much better than 22k.

          be needed, try removing it if this circuit sounds poor.
