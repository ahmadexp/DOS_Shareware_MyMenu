   HOW TO START
   ============

Before playing,  you need to configure the game for your hardware.  You can
do this either by typing "LW2 CFG" or by typing just "LW2" and selecting the
first menu option "Configure LineWars II". Go thru the menu choices and
select the hardware you have. Remember to press F1 for help any time you
are in doubt!

Note:   YOU DO NOT NEED TO CONFIGURE EVERYTHING AT ONCE.  Also, if you play
        the game without configuring,  it should work fine,  but you'll
        miss the music,  sound effects,  and high-resolution graphics.

Once you've configured the game,  you'll be able to start playing.  Type
"LW2" and select the mission you wish to play.  If the game does not start
properly,  you probably have given an incorrect piece of information in the
configuration,  so run the configuration again to remedy this.

   Modem Play
   ==========
To play a two-player game of Line Wars II over a modem, type "LWMODEM"
and enter the settings for your modem and the telephone number of the
person with whom you will be playing.  The defaults will work for
most Hayes-compatible modems.  For more details about playing the
modem missions, refer to the "LWMODEM.DOC" file.


   CONTROLS
   ========

This is a list of the default keys used to control LineWars II. You can
change the laser and missile keys on the configuration screen. If you do
this,  you can see what your new choices are by pressing F1 in the game
to view the key help page. You can also use mouse or joystick for the ship
controls.

   THE STORY
   =========

Recently receiving your Fighter Pilots License, you are assigned to guard
a remote outpost in the obscure Deneb star system.  The more seasoned pilots,
you would normally have as comrades, have been assigned to locate the rebel
pirate base, rumoured to be hidden near a neighbouring star system.

Since no pirate activity has been detected in your assigned system for many
years, StarBase Captain Wanobi has decided to keep only you and the 110-year
old cyborg, Sir Dak Wyntol, who was a fighter in the historical battle at
Aldebaran, to protect the StarBase.

You are virtually alone on the StarBase when SpaceWatch sensors detect an
asteroid storm coming straight towards the StarBase! You must launch
immediately to protect the base from being hit by asteroids.

As you are boarding your ship, Captain Wanobi says, "I will recommend your
promotion and transfer to the Princess Royal Guard, if you can save our base."
The promise seems incredible since the Royal Guard is the most highly covetted
post that a fighter pilot can possibly imagine!

You board your ship and launch to destroy the asteroids. You are determined
to save the base, even though the mission seems quite impossible.  Soon after
your launch Sir Dak Wyntol will launch to help you, though nobody expects him
to be of any help.

Continued on Mission 1: "The Asteroid Storm"...
