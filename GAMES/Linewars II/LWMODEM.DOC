1.0  INTRODUCTION

LWMODEM is designed to automate the process of configuring and 
starting a two-player game of Line Wars II over a modem connection.

Before attempting to run Line Wars II in two-player mode, make sure
it works on your computer in single-player mode.  Once you are sure
that Line Wars II works in single-player mode, you can prepare for
a two player game by typing the command "LWMODEM" at the DOS prompt.


2.0  CONFIGURATION SCREEN

When LWMODEM is first started, it displays the modem configuration
screen.  The modem configuration screen allows you to change all
of the settings that will allow your modem to work with Line Wars
II in two-player mode.  The configuration fields include the
following:

"Modem initialization command"
   This field contains the command that must be sent to your
   modem to properly initialize it.  The default command works
   for many Hayes-compatible modems, but some modems require
   special commands to work properly with Line Wars II.  For
   example, the US Robotics Sportster 14.4 needs to have the
   characters "&B1" added to the end of the default command
   in order for it to work with Line Wars II.  If you experience
   repeated problems in getting Line Wars II to establish a
   connection between your modem and the other player's modem,
   refer to your modem reference manual for any additional
   commands that may be necessary for your modem.

"Modem auto-answer command"
   This field contains the command that must be sent to your
   modem to place it into auto-answer mode.  The default command
   works for most Hayes-compatible modems.  If you experience
   difficulties in getting your modem to answer calls from
   the other player's modem, you may wish to try using the
   manual-answer mode instead.

"Modem manual-answer command"
   This field contains the command that must be sent to your
   modem to tell it to pick up the phone line immediately.  The
   default works for many Hayes-compatible modems.

"Modem connect response string"
   This field must contain the message that your modem
   sends back to the computer to indicate that a successful
   connection has been established with another modem.  The
   default of "CONNECT" works for most Hayes-compatible modems.

"Connection timeout"
   This field contains the number of seconds that your modem
   will wait to establish a connection with another modem
   after initiating a session on the "Session Options" screen
   (this is explained in more detail later).

"COM channel"
   Use this field to select which serial communications port
   (COM port) your modem is connected to.

"COM speed"
   This field contains a number indicating the speed at which
   data is transferred between your computer and your modem.
   This is commonly set to the same speed (baud rate) at which
   your modem communicates with the other player's modem, but
   may be faster if desired.

"Hardware Handshaking"
   Use this field to select whether the computer will use 
   hardware handshaking when communicating to the modem.  
   Set this to "OFF" to disable hardware handshaking, or set 
   to "Use CTS/RTS" to enable hardware handshaking.  If you 
   are using a modem that is slower than 9600 baud or are 
   connecting to another modem that is slower than 9600 
   baud, we recommend that hardware handshaking be enabled.  
   Hardware handshaking is not supported by some modems and 
   serial cabling, so you may need to experiment to 
   determine what is the best setting for your particular 
   situation.  

"Mission"
   Use this field to select which two-player mission you wish
   to play.  In the shareware edition of Line Wars II, the
   only available choice is "Duel mode", in which you command
   a squad of Cobra fighters that is pitted in battle against
   another squad of Cobras commanded by the other player.
   In the registered edition of Line Wars II, another choice
   "Wing Mode" is added, in which you and the other player
   are teammates pitted in battle against another squad of
   enemy ships.

"Telephone number"
   Select this field to go to the Telephone Directory screen.
   The telephone number that is hilighted in the telephone
   directory screen will show up in this field on the
   configuration screen, and is the number that will be
   dialed by your modem if you select the "Initiate a call to
   another computer" option on the Session Options screen.

"START A LINE WARS II MODEM SESSION"
   Select this field when all other fields have been configured
   as desired and you are ready to being playing a two-player
   game of Line Wars II using your modem.

To move the cursor, use the cursor keys or the tab key.  To
select a field for editing, move the cursor to that field and
press the ENTER key.

To exit from LWMODEM, press the ESC key at the configuration
screen.  Upon exiting, any changes that you made to the
configuration will be saved to the "LWMODEM.CFG" file.


3.0  TELEPHONE DIRECTORY SCREEN

The telephone directory screen maintains the names and 
telephone numbers of up to eight people with whom you play 
two-player games of Line Wars II using the modem.

The lefthand column displays the names and the righthand
column displays the telephone numbers.  To begin editing a
field, move the cursor to the desired field using the cursor
keys or the tab key and then press ENTER.  When you are
done editing a field, press ENTER again.

To select the telephone number that will be dialed when
you start a Line Wars II modem session, move the cursor
to the desired name or telephone number and press the F10
key.  After F10 is pressed, you will be returned to the
configuration screen with the selected telephone number
displayed in the "Telephone number" field.


4.0  SESSION OPTIONS SCREEN

The session options screen is displayed after selecting "START
A LINE WARS II MODEM SESSION" from the configuration screen.
Session Options allows you to perform any of the following
actions by moving the cursor to the desired option and pressing
the ENTER key.

"Initiate a call to another computer"
   Select this option if you want your modem to call the other
   player's modem.  Once this option has been selected, your
   modem will immediately dial the telephone number that was
   selected on the configuration screen and wait for the modem
   at that number to answer.

"Wait for a call from another computer (auto-answer)"
   Select this option if your modem has auto-answer capability
   and you want your modem to answer when the other player's
   modem calls your modem.  Once this option has been selected,
   the modem will wait until it either receives a call or the
   time specified by the "Connection timeout" field on the
   configuration screen has elapsed.

"Answer a call from another computer (manual-answer)"
   Select this option if your modem does not have auto-answer
   capability.  When this option is selected, it immediately
   picks up the phone line, so wait until the phone rings
   before selecting this option.

"Return to configuration screen"
   Select this option to cancel the Line Wars II modem session
   and go back to the modem configuration screen.


5.0  AFTER THE MODEM CONNECTS

After your modem reports that a connection has been established 
(whether your modem made the call or answered the call), LWMODEM 
will start the Line Wars II program (LW2.COM) in two-player mode.

At this point you should see the message "waiting for handshake"
below the spaceship's viewscreen.  This message should appear
briefly and then disappear after your copy of Line Wars II
begins to receive communications from the other player's copy
of Line Wars II.  If "waiting for handshake" does not disappear,
it indicates that there is some problem with the connection
between the two machines.  It may be a problem of mismatched
baud rates, error correction protocols, compression protocols,
etc, which vary from modem to modem.  Refer to your modem
reference manual if "waiting for handshake" problems persist.

If everything has worked up to this point, the two-player game will 
begin.  Piloting the ship in a two-player game is the same as in a 
single-player game, as are most other aspects of the game.  For more 
details on how to play Line Wars II, refer to the "LW2.DOC" file.

             FRIEND, YOUR MODEM, AND LINE WARS II !!
