                   
                   PC CD-ROM VERSION OF "EARTHWORM JIM"

                   DOUBLES THE PLEASURE, DOUBLES THE FUN

Playmates Interactive Entertainment Brings Its "Annelid with an Attitude"
to Home Computers in Earthworm Jim 1 & 2: The Whole Can O' Worms


Playmates Interactive Entertainment (P.I.E.) is comprising its wacky 16-bit
platform titles Earthworm Jim and Earthworm Jim 2 onto two PC CD-ROMS
aptly-named Earthworm Jim 1 & 2: The Whole Can O' Worms.


Developed for P.I.E. by Germany-based Rainbow Arts (part of the Funsoft
group), EWJ-1&2 will be comprised of two disks featuring eighteen levels of
the classic 16-bit titles, from the initial junkyard level where Earthworm
Jim battles the trash can boss to the famous race against Jim's evil
rival Psy-Crow. With over 40 hours of game play, passcodes, and enhanced
music along with 256-color graphics (including many new illustrations), this
version of Earthworm Jim delivers double the fun. The game is "Windows 95
Autoplay enabled", allowing you to easily run the game through Win
95's MS-DOS mode.

"Earthworm Jim is going to be the hottest property around this year,
beginning with our Nintendo and Sega games, the Playmates Toys' action
figures, along with the Kids WB animated series," notes David Luehmann, 
vice president of P.I.E. "Combining both video game versions into one CD-ROM
package encourages new Jim fans to try out 'part one', while those who've
played the first one will enjoy part two."

Scheduled to be included on the two CD-ROMs are full-color photos of
Playmates Toys action figure characters (including Earthworm Jim,
Princess What's-Her-Name and Psy-Crow), with footage from the Universal
Cartoon Studios "Earthworm Jim" animated series. The cartoon sequences will
be presented in full-screen format featuring more than 32,000 colors!!

Earthworm Jim's story begins when, fleeing from a predator crow, Jim
suddenly finds himself the wearer of an all-powerful, indestructible,
cyber-netic suit that fell onto his body from outerspace. Armed with a
plasma blaster, he sets our to rescue the charming Princess
What's-Her-Name, the object of his desire, but he must first battle
Psy-Crow and the most bizarre collection of bad guys ever imagined,
including Professor Monkey-for-a-Head, Major Mucus, and Bob with #4, a
Napoleon-esque goldfish and his henchcat. Part one features bungee jumping,
undersea hijinx, a place called "Heck," and a hidden level that literally
keeps you "in the dark."

In part two, Jim traverses the universe to prevent Psy-Crow from reaching
"Lost Vegas" for a quickie wedding with the princess. Following the pair
from planet to planet, Jim must overcome obstacles in such strange worlds
as "Lorenzen's Soil," "The Villi People," "Inflated Head," and "Udderly
Abducted." Among the many foes he must evade include pea-shooting cats,
flying Sumo/Roman centurions, mutant superpowered penguins, and repressed
Grannies.

Information on the Earthworm Jim demos:

Minimum system requirements to run the Earthworm Jim demos:

- IBM 486Dx compatible or better (Pentium is preferred)
- 8MB RAM (16 Mb RAM is preferred)
- Sound Blaster or compatible.

If you have to run these demos under Win95, Shutdown your Win95, and reboot
in DOS mode (This will of course work in the final version of the game just
not the preview).

General command keys:

'P'     Pause / unpause the game.
'ESC'   Exit to the title-screen. If you already are on the title screen, the
        program will exit to DOS.
'F1'    Scroll Fix for Tseng3000 video cards. The old Tseng3000 video card
        (and other possibly) have some problems when panning. Pressing this
        key will fix the problem.
'F2'    Adjust frame rate. On some PC's it happens that the EWJ game is running
        at an unstable frame rate. Try pressing this button up to three times
        to fix it. Pressing it the fourth time will set the frame rate values
        to default.
'F3'    Toggle between 240 and 200 lines display. Very useable for slow video
        cards.

'J'     Joypad on/off.

'R'     Joypad recalibration. This function recalibrates the joypad "on the fly".
        simply move the direction pad in all directions and the joypad will
        be recalibrated.

'Alt X' This command exits the game and puts you into DOS.
        
Earthworm Jim 1 control:

'Alt'   Fire your plasma Blaster, or any other weapon you get. Also acts as an
        accelerator for your rocket.
'Shift' Does the head Whip, and the "Hamster Bite" (you'll find out...),
        along with the bungee shove. Activates shields during the rocket flights.
'Ctrl'  Makes Jim jump, or when airborne, turn Jim's head into a rapidly 
        rotating helicopter blade.

Arrow keys

        Controls which way you move and which direction you are facing. What did you
        think it did? if you encounter problems with the diagonal directions
        use the arrow keys on the numeric keypad instead.

Earthworm Jim #2 control:

'Alt'   Fires the current weapon indicated in the lower left corner of the
        screen. When airborne, activates the Snott parachute.

'Shift' Makes Jim whip with his head.

'Ctrl'  Makes Jim Jump, and activates Snott when airborne.

'TAB'   Cycles through all of Jim's currently held weapons.

Arrow keys

        Oh, it controls the direction Jim moves and fires.


To start the EWJ demos make sure to run the Setup program first. 

Note:   The setup program will create a directory on your 'C' drive called "EWJ".
        In the directory, a small configuration file will be used
        by the game.

After you have runned the setup program, then just type: 
        EWJ followed by <ENTER>.

NOTE:

If you have a Tseng4000 video card, there might appear some palette problems.
This bug will be fixed in the final release of the game.

        Good Luck,
