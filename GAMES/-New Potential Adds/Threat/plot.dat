        Weird  worms and  huge spiders
have been seen in an old mine.     You
have to check if they are dangerous.


        The aliens are inside the city
walls. Somehow, a little group has
succeeded to enter an abandoned
warehouse  near the city  border. Find
them!
        The  creatures  have  occupied
one of the  Colony's ammonition depot.
Destroy all explosives and try to  get
back alive.

       Monsters are trying to establish
a teleport place to beam  more enemies
near  our  citizens.      The place is
somewhere in our sewer system.  Locate
the room and kill the guards.
       Just  run  and  do  not  search
every corner!













       Destroy the radioactive barrels
which  could  be   dangerous  if  used
against the city.


       One of our  Security Force Unit
transmitted  us a message,  that there
are  eggs of Slimers in  a cave on the
other side of the asteroid.   The Unit
didn't survive.





       Our radars have located a place
where  the  alien  ships  are landing.
       -- This is important! --
Destroy  the  ships  and  their  fuel.
The ships could be heavily guarded.





       You  must  face the  horrors of
a deadly spider nest.








       The first  strike of  creatures
is beginning to end.    However,  they
still have a  large pile of explosives
hidden in some alien village.   Try to
stay alive to be teleported back!
       You have heard terrible rumours
about  the  big alien  bosses  who are
invulnerable. You must  face  them and
their servants. The end is near.
