                             ---------	

This document should be read if you have any problems with Fire and Ice.

This game cannot run under Windows(tm) due to that way in which Windows(tm)
alters certain hardware timings. These make scrolling the screen smoothly
impossible, so you must exit Windows and play the game from your normal
DOS prompt. The same may be true of some other multi-tasking environments,
but this has not been tested. If in doubt, run from real DOS, not DOS in
a window.

Assuming you have installed your files in a simple games directory,
type the following:-

CD C:\GAMES\FIRE&ICE <ENTER>
FIRE <ENTER>

Command line options can also be appended, more information follows.

Hardware Options
----------------

After starting the game you will be presented with a series of option
menus. In all cases press the number key corresponding to the option
you require. If an option is not currently available to you it will be
blacked out and you will be unable to select it.

Control Method

The options available are Keyboard or Analogue Joystick. It is not
possible to control Cool Coyote using a Mouse.

As it is not always possible to tell if a joystick is attached to
your PC the Joystick Option is always available even if you may not
have a Joystick. Do not select this option unless a Joystick is
attached to your PC and in Joystick Port 1 (if you have more than
one Joystick port). If you do select Joystick by mistake or subsequently
change your mind you will be able to reselect Keyboard later in the game.
The same applies to changing from Keyboard back to Joystick.

The default key options are:-

Q=Jump Up  A=Crouch/Fall faster  O=Left/Veer  P=Right/Veer  <Space Bar>=Fire

A combination of Up and Left/Right will give diagonal jumps.

See the manual for a fuller explanation of the control method.


Video Selection
---------------
Options available here are VGA (16 Colour Mode) and EGA. If you do not
have a VGA Card the VGA option will be unavailable to you.


Sound Selection
---------------
The game supports the Roland(tm) LAPC-1, SoundBlaster(tm), Adlib (tm)
and the Internal Speaker (Beeper). Any other sound card which claims to
be either SoundBlaster(tm) or Adlib(tm) compatible should also be fully
supported. A further option of No Sound at all is also available.

If you have a SoundBlaster(tm) card it will be the second available
option. If you do not have a SoundBlaster(tm) card the second option
will be Adlib(tm)

When using the SoundBlaster(tm) option the game will attempt to search
for the correct PORT address, DMA Channel and IRQ for your card. 
Occasionally it is possible for hardware conflicts to cause the machine
to lock up during the search process. If you have had any problems in the
past you will have taken note of your PORT, DMA and IRQ and will be able
to supply them to the game. See Command Line Options.

Speed Selection

The game has been designed with both fast and slower PCs in mind and has
two sets of game data. Players with modest 8086-80286 PCs should select
one of the options 1,2 or 3 and players with faster 80836 and above PCs
should select one of the options 4,5 or 6. You will be prompted with the
most appropriate speed for your machine.

If you have a fairly slow machine some of the higher speed settings may be
unavailable, although you should always be able to select at least one
setting above the optimum for your machine, to allow for inaccuracies in
the power reading test. Normal options are 2 and 5, but if you want a
bit of a speed advantage or are an experienced player you could select
one of the other options.

Command Line Options
====================

These are entered after the word 'FIRE' (or FIRE.EXE) and remove the need
for selecting options via the option boxes, as described above. If any 
form of valid command line option is selected then none of the above 
option boxes will be displayed. Any selections you make will be used and
any others will have defaults, of which more follows.

Only the first two letters of each option are significant and can be in
upper or lower case.

/VGA     Select VGA graphics.

/EGA     Select EGA graphics.

/JOY     Select Joystick, you will be prompted to calibrate it later.

/KEY     Select Keyboard, initially set to default keys.

/ROLAND  Select Roland(tm) Board.

/ADLIB   Select Adlib(tm) Board.

/BLASTER Select SoundBlaster(tm).

/BEEPER  Select Beeper.

/NOSOUND Do not select any sound at all.

/SPEED=  Select a game speed. Values are 1,2,3,4,5 and 6. If you select a
         high speed on a slow PC you will not get a faster game, but a slower
         one, as options 4,5 and 6 use a different set of data for faster PCs.

	 The default is 5, so if you have a slow PC you MUST select a different
         speed if you use any of these command line options.

/PORT=   Select a port address for your SoundBlaster Card if selected and
         present. Acceptable values are 210,220,230,240,250,260 and 270.
         The Default is normally 220.
         The SoundBlaster Pro(2) can usually only accept values of 220 or 240.

/DMA=    The DMA Channel for your SoundBlaster. Acceptable values are 0,1 or 3.
         Do NOT select 2, this is used by your Hard Disc.
         The Default is normally 1.
         Normal SoundBlasters (NOT Pro) can usually only accept a value of 1.

/IRQ=    The IRQ for your SoundBlaster. Acceptable values for a Normal Blaster
         are 2,3,5 or 7. The Default is usually 7.
         Acceptable values for a SoundBlaster Pro(2) are 2,5,7 or 10. Again,
         the Default is usually 7.
  

If this is the first game you have tried with a SoundBlaster and you are having
a hardware conflict and you don't know what your settings are, then you must
experiment with the valid values for your card until you find a combination
of DMA, PORT and IRQ that works. See your SoundCard manual for more information.

If you DO select any of PORT, DMA or IRQ you MUST supply a port address for
the program to take notice of your DMA and IRQ selections. However you do
not have to supply DMA and IRQ settings if you only want to select the PORT.
They will defaut to 1 and 7 respectively.

ie. PORT+DMA+IRQ=allowed, DMA+IRQ (no PORT)=ignored, PORT=allowed.

Although you are allowed to select VGA, ROLAND, ADLIB, SOUNDBLASTER and 
JOYSTICK even though you may not have them, doing so will probably cause
your machine to lock up if the hardware really is not present, especially
in the case of the sound cards. The command line options are for speed and
convenience and are intended to be used in a batch file therefore to avoid
problems problems, do not select options that would normally be unavailable
from the option boxes.


Default Values for any selections not made are as follows:

Control method will be keyboard.
Video option will attempt to select VGA if available.
Sound option will attempt to select Roland, SoundBlaster, Adlib in order if
present. If none are available it will default to Beeper.
Speed option will always default to 5. If you have a slower PC and are using
command line options you MUST select either 1,2 or 3. 2 is normal speed for
8086-80286 PCs.

Some Examples:

Fire /Blast /PORT=220 /DMA=1 /Joy /ega /Speed=2
FIRE /Rol /VGA /Key
Fire /Adlib /Joy /VGA /SPEED=6
fire /key

Changing play options
---------------------

Pressing F1 at most times will bring up a selection menu.
This will allow you to select: sound and music on/off, recalibrate your
joystick, redefine the keys, play some of the game tunes on the
jukebox, select the size (or complete absence) of the small maps,
and whether to train on one of the first four worlds (out of seven)
or play the game from the beginning. Control of the menu is by the
cursor keys. Selections are made by pressing <Space> or <Enter>.

Selecting <--<< from a sub menu will take you back to the main menu.
Selecting EXIT from the main menu will take you back to the game.
Pressing <ESC> at any time will take you back to the game.


Also, you may also save and restore your settings to/from disc.
This includes your music/sound selection, joystick calibration data,
small maps selection, keyboard definitions and the current high scores.

If you do not save any of your settings, the high scores are saved out
to disc automatically on quitting the game, but nothing else is.
 
The last two tunes on the jukebox are not available until you have
completed the game, when this information will be saved out, so they will
continue to be available on the jukebox from then on. It is possible to
complete the game without visiting every land or secret location, so
you'll want to go back and find the ones you missed, won't you?


Music and Sound Effects On/Off
------------------------------
Pressing F2 at most times will toggle the music on/off and pressing
F3 will likewise toggle sound effects on/off.

Pause and Quit to DOS
---------------------

Pressing <ESC> once will pause the game, pressing it a second time
will abort a game to the titles page. Pressing any other key (or fire
on the joystick, if selected) will continue the game.
