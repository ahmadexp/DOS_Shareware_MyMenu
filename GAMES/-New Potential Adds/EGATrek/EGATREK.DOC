       A space combat game similar to EGATrek was one of the first
       computer games ever written.  The first versions were written
       for mini and mainframe computers back in the early 1970's.
       There have probably been more versions of this game written than
       any other as there is probably at least one version around for
       every type of computer ever made.  This game is definitely a
       classic.

       The version you now have is related to the other versions in its
       basic game play, but fully takes advantage of the high resolution
       of the EGA or VGA display.  I originally discovered the game
       around 1974 running on a DEC System 10 mini and was soon hooked.
       I've since written several other versions of the game for
       computers including the Timex-Sinclair ZX81, Apple ][, Prime
       50-series minis and MS-DOS machines, all using BASIC of one sort
       or another.

       This game requires an MS-DOS computer with an EGA or VGA capable
       card and monitor.  It should work fine on VGA systems as well.
       If you're still running an older display adapter that doesn't
       support EGA or VGA I'm afraid you're out of luck running this
       particular game.  I suspect you can find a version that supports
       your system though.
  
       SHAREWARE
  
       EGATrek is distributed under the "shareware" concept, also known
       as "user-supported software".  Under this concept, you save the
       high cost of packaging and distribution while still receiving
       high quality software.  You are free, and in fact encouraged, to
       distribute this software to your friends, to BBS's and to user
       groups.  Companies that provide software duplication services may
       include EGATrek in their catalog and provide copies for a
       reasonable duplication fee.  All copies must include the files
       "egatrek.exe", "egatrek.doc", "egatrek.ref", "orderfrm.txt",
       "egatrek.txt", and "file_id.diz".  You are not allowed to modify
       the files in any way, and this shareware notice must be kept
       intact.  The author retains all other rights to the program.
  
       Under the Shareware system you may freely try out this program,
       but if you continue to use it you are expected to register with
       the author and pay the $15 (plus $2 shipping/handling)
       registration fee.  In return for your registration you'll
       receive the latest version of the game, and if possible another
       game to try out.  There is also a "deluxe" version available
       which includes a binder, printed manual and quick reference
       card.  The "deluxe" version is $22 (plus $4 shipping/handling).

       I'd be happy to hear of any improvements you'd like to see, as
       well as any bug reports.  Many of the new features since the
       original version of the game came about as suggestions from users.
  
       When you register, please let me know what version you have
       and I'd also be interested in knowing where you got it from.
       Please, make sure to put your name and address on the letter!
       It's amazing how many people don't do this.  Or, you can use
       the instant registration form in the file "orderfrm.txt".
       Just copy the file to your printer.

       If you live outside the U.S., the best way to register appears
       to be by using postal money orders.  I've received these from
       quite a few countries.  In general, foreign checks are not
       accepted by U.S. banks (Canadian checks are an exception, but
       please allow for the difference in U.S. and Canadian dollars).
       EuroCheques, for example, are not acceptable to the bank.  You
       can also charge your registration to VISA or MasterCard.

       If you live in the U.K. you can register through Nildram
       Software.  Please print the file UKORDER.TXT for an order form
       all ready to go or just send #12.95 to:

       As humans ventured into deep space it was inevitable that other
       races of intelligent beings would be discovered.  While many
       races are friendly and some have even become allies several
       hostile and violent races have been discovered.  The two most
       notable hostile races are known as the Mongols and the Vandals.
       Though these are not their real names (the words they use for
       their names being impossible for the human tongue to pronounce)
       these terms have been assigned as standard terminology based on
       the convention of using the names of appropriately violent early
       human cultures.

       Recently, the Mongol Empire has declared war on the Union.  As a
       result, a Mongol invasion fleet is now present in parts of Union
       territory.  A large number of enemy cruisers, a few command
       vessels and a Mongol starbase have been observed.

       The Vandal Empire has joined the hostilities in some areas but
       should be avoided if possible.  They will generally only be
       found near their own territory.  Their actions in response to
       your contact are unpredictable.

       You will be in command of the Class IX Research/Battle Cruiser
       Lexington, fleet designation RCB-92.  As is common fleet
       procedure the ship is named after a historic earth ocean ship.
       It is fully battle ready with 430 officers and crew members on
       board.

       Your mission as commander of the Lexington is to secure a 64
       quadrant section of the galaxy as quickly as possible.  You will
       have to destroy any Mongol vessels you find, including normal
       Mongol battle cruisers, command vessels and possibly other types
       as well.  Depending on the command level (your military rank)
       that you enter when starting you will be given a more or less
       difficult section.  In general, higher levels must contend with
       more enemy ships and with more abilities and phenomena in the
       enemy.  Success in your mission may earn you a promotion to a
       higher rank.

       Ranks are as follows:

              Level Number    Name of Rank
              ------------    ------------
                   1          Lieutenant Commander
                   2          Commander
                   3          Captain
                   4          Commodore
                   5          Admiral

       Any officer in command of a ship may be referred to as captain
       regardless of his actual rank.
  
       The Lexington has a cruising speed of up to warp factor 6, and
       is allowed warp 8 in emergencies.  The main engines are for
       moving between quadrants of the galaxy.  Beware of excessive
       speed as damage to the engines is a possible result.  Within a
       quadrant, you have the use of impulse engines.  If your main
       engines are damaged your maximum warp speed will be lower than
       normal.  Travel at warp speeds with the shields raised requires
       double the normal amount of energy.

       All energy is provided by the Space Industries EnergyConverter.
       The energy conversion system is normally adequate to supply all
       needed power for many years of operation.  However, war with the
       Mongols is hardly normal operations.  Because the ship is moving
       more often than normal and using a great deal of energy to fire
       lasers and provide shielding you will most likely be using
       energy faster than you can regenerate it.  The converter will
       supply 400 units of energy per stardate when working at 100%.

       The ship is provided with two types of scanners.  The short range
       scanners show you everything in your current quadrant.  Because
       of their importance they continue scanning at all times and the
       display is always available and up to date.  The most important
       thing you will see is, of course, Mongol ships of which there
       are several types.  Standard Mongol battleships will display in
       light blue, command ships in red, scout ships in purple and
       supply ships in green.

       Your long range scanners show what is in adjacent quadrants and
       thus are very useful for planning your movements.  The ships
       computer keeps a record of all past scans and this galaxy chart
       is shown at all times unless the computer is damaged.  Damage to
       the scanners will affect their performance of course.  A small
       amount of damage will prevent them from seeing smaller objects
       (including, unfortunately, enemy ships) but they may still be
       able to see stars.  If damage becomes too severe they will fail
       to work at all.

       The long range display is numerical; the three digit number for
       each quadrant represents the number of Mongols, type of friendly
       star base, and number of stars (respectively) that the scanners
       have found.  Quadrants containing Mongols are highlighted in
       red.  Bases are highlighted in orange and the number indicates
       base type (1 is a StarBase, 2 a research station and 3 a supply
       depot).  Quadrants with supernovas cause the scanners to
       overload and display all 9's.

       You also receive information through the main viewer.  This
       display alternates between a view from outside the ship and a
       graphical display of some ship function.  When looking outside
       the ship the viewer always looks in the direction of whatever
       enemy ship is closest to your ship.  The view includes an
       identification of the object and its relative distance and
       direction from the ship.  Directions are based on 0 degrees being
       directly to the right as seen on scanner displays.

       The graphical displays appearing on the viewer can be more or
       less useful depending on what's currently going on.  Some of the
       displays are not of much use to a ships commander however.

       You will constantly be receiving communications from both inside
       and outside your ship.  Each message will include the ships
       department that originated it.  It is important that you pay
       attention to all incoming messages.  Up to four messages can be
       displayed on your command console at a time.  Each new message
       will overwrite the oldest existing message or you can acknowledge
       one or all messages and so leave space for new ones.

       Your ship has two major weapons available, energy torpedoes
       (EnTorps) and lasers.  Torpedoes are very effective at close
       range, with a single torpedo being capable of destroying a
       standard Mongol ship.  However, you are limited in the number of
       torpedoes you can carry and they can only be replenished at a
       StarBase or supply station.  At longer distances they are less
       effective and their accuracy is also thrown off when fired with
       your shields raised.

       Lasers are your general purpose weapon.  The damage lasers do is
       highly influenced by distance to the target.  There are two
       gauges that monitor laser performance.  You should watch the
       laser temperature gauge when firing to prevent overheating.  The
       laser effectiveness gauge shows how well the lasers are working.
       Laser effectiveness goes down due to excess heat and due to
       damage from enemy fire.

       The ship is capable of repulsing enemy fire through the use of
       its shields.  When the shields are raised and at 100% energy no
       enemy fire will penetrate them; the only effect will be that
       energy will drain from the shields.  It is thus to your
       advantage to have shields raised when in direct battle.  Once
       enemy fire starts to penetrate the shields main energy is lost
       and ships systems may be damaged.  Raising the shields draws a
       small amount of energy from the main energy banks so you do not
       want to raise the shields needlessly.  Lowering shields causes
       no energy change.  Because the shields affect the performance of
       other ships systems their correct usage is very important to the
       success of your mission.

       The Lexington was originally used for exploration and is well
       suited for this purpose.  Obviously, with the Union under attack
       there is no time for normal exploration at the present.
       However, there are planets in the galaxy that may contain the
       energium used to power the ship and it is worth exploring these
       planets for emergency energium supplies.  Note, though, that
       regulations prohibit the use of raw energium except in extreme
       emergencies; your shields must be under 50% and main energy
       under 20%.

       There are several types of Union bases in space.  A StarBase is
       the most useful because you can replenish all ships supplies
       there.  Supply stations can provide life support supplies and
       energy torpedoes.  Research stations can provide only life
       support supplies.  You are responsible for the protection of all
       bases in your designated area.

       During warfare many of the ships systems may be damaged.  The
       effects of damage on your mission can vary greatly depending on
       what systems are affected:

       EnergyConverter: The ship's energy converter generates energy
         for the ship at a rate of 400 units/day times percentage of
         repair.
       Shields: The shields percentage of repair indicates how
         efficiently the shield generators can convert the energy
         available in the shield system into actual shielding of the ship.
       Warp Engines: The warp engines are virtually impossible to
         destroy completely, but their level of damage affects the maximum
         possible warp speed.  The maximum warp speed is approximately
         warp 1 plus 0.09 times percentage of repair.
       Impulse Engines: Impulse engines are much simpler than warp
         engines; they either work or they don't.  When they are at less
         than 50% they simply stop functioning.
       Lasers: Laser percentage of repair is a direct indication of
         what percentage of energy is converted to destructive force at
         the point of impact.  In other words, for a given level of laser
         energy, 100% working lasers will do twice the damage of 50%
         working lasers.
       EnTorp Tubes: Like impulse engines, torpedo tubes either work or
         they don't.  At 100% there are three functional tubes, 67-99% only
         two tubes work and 34-66% only one. 
       Short Range Scanners: Short range scanners lose resolution when
         they are damaged.  Above 90% they are fully functional, but below
         90% they are unable to detect anything smaller than a star.
         Below 50% they do not function at all.
       Long Range Scanners: Long range scanners also lose resolution
         when damaged.  When less than 100% repaired they can no longer
         detect enemy ships.  Below 50% they are not functional.
       Computer: A modern starship is highly computerized, so loss of
         computer function affects a number of things.  Portions of the
         ships charts can be lost if the computer is sufficiently damaged
         and can only be recovered by re-scanning.  Automatic navigation
         requires the computer to be 100% repaired.
       Life Support: Life support systems must be 100% to generate food
         and oxygen needed to sustain life.  Without a functioning life
         support system the ship can last only two days on reserves.
       Transporter:  The transporter must be at 100% to be used.
       Shuttlecraft:  The shuttlecraft must be at 100% to be used.

       When your mission ends, one way or another, you'll receive a
       detailed evaluation of your performance from headquarters.  If
       you get one of the top two scores for your command level, your
       name will be entered in the hall of fame.  If you wish to delete
       the hall of fame simply delete the file trek.scr.

       To start the game, enter "egatrek" from the DOS prompt.  If you do
       not want sound during the game, enter "egatrek -n"; note that the
       space before the dash is required.

       The following is a list of commands and their description.  Most
       commands can be abbreviated to just their first letter.  Use the
       "HELP" command at any time to get the list of commands and their
       abbreviations.
  
         A#:
              To acknowledge a message you should enter the letter A
              immediately followed by the number of the message you wish
              to acknowledge, i.e. A2.  Messages are numbered from 1 to 4
              going from top to bottom.  To acknowledge all messages enter
              just A without a number.
  
         DOCK:
              You will need to visit StarBases often to refuel your ship
              as well as to make repairs.  When you are in a sector
              directly adjacent to a StarBase, issue this command.  You
              can also dock at Research Stations and Supply Bases, but
              they cannot provide everything that a StarBase can.  When
              docked at a StarBase its shields will protect your ship from
              enemy lasers.
  
         ENERGY:
              Energy is used by a number of different systems aboard the
              ship and you can use this command to move energy between
              systems as needed.  It will also show you the exact energy
              levels of all systems.
  
         FIX:
              Engineering has a certain number of crewmen available to do
              repairs on damaged systems and they normally divide their
              time evenly among all damaged systems.  Since some systems
              are more important than others you can use this command to
              concentrate repairs on one system at the expense of other
              systems.  When the system you selected is repaired, repair
              work will automatically be divided among all damaged
              systems once again.

              In addition, you will be asked if you want to spend time
              just making repairs.  In space, repairs will take place no
              faster than normal.  If docked at a StarBase you can use
              their facilities to speed repairs.
       
              Relative repair speeds are as follows:
       
                1x    Normal repairs, work evenly divided among systems
                2.5x  Normal repairs while docked at a starbase
                3x    Repairing only a selected system
                5x    Repairing a selected system while docked at a starbase
  
         HAIL:
              Use this command to hail a StarBase.  If none is close by,
              it will take some time to receive a reply.

         HELP:
              Use this command to get a list of all available commands and
              their abbreviations.
  
         INFO:
              This command allows you to get information about the enemy
              ships in the present quadrant from the computer.  The
              display will show the ship type, location, distance and
              heading from you, and the condition of its shields.

         LAND:
              If you are orbiting a planet which has something of
              interest on it you can use this command to land on the
              planet.  You have the option of using the transporter or
              shuttlecraft to reach the planet.  Normally the transporter
              is the better choice since the shuttlecraft takes 0.2
              stardays to make the round trip whereas the transporter is
              virtually instantaneous.

              To use this command, you must first successfully use the
              ORBIT command.
  
         MAX:
              This command diverts the maximum possible amount of power
              to the ship's main shields.  You can do the same thing with
              the E)nergy command by transferring power to the shields
              until they are at 2500.  This command is a quick way to 
              make sure that your shields are at full strength.

         MOVE:
              This ship is quite sophisticated, so getting from one place
              to another requires only that you specify where you want to
              go.  The galaxy is divided into 64 quadrants and each
              quadrant is divided into 64 sectors.  You need only to
              specify the quadrant and sector you wish to move to; for
              example 6,2,3,5 moves you to quadrant 6,2 sector 3,5.
              Vertical coordinates are always entered first.  To use
              impulse power to move within a quadrant specify only the
              sector you wish to move to (i.e. 3,5).
  
              If the navigation computer is damaged, however, you will
              have to calculate movements manually.  You will be asked
              first for a DeltaX (vertical) movement which can be
              negative, positive or zero.  The number before the decimal
              point is the number of quadrants to move, and the number
              after the decimal point the number of sectors.  Both digits
              must be in the range 0 to 7.  The DeltaY (horizontal)
              movement works the same way.  For example, if you want to
              move one quadrant down and two quadrants plus two sectors
              left (i.e., from 1,8,1,8 to 2,6,1,6) DeltaX would be 1.0
              and DeltaY would be -2.2.  If you prefer using this method
              even when the computer is functional, enter just an "M"
              when asked for the coordinates and the computer will switch
              movement entry to manual.
  
              The key to understanding manual movement is that you are
              specifying a distance to move relative to your current position
              whereas with automated movement you just select the actual
              position you wish to move to.

              If you prefer, you can enter the move coordinates without
              anything separating them.  For example, 6,2,3,5 is
              equivalent to 6235 and 3,5 is equivalent to 35.  When using
              the long form, you can use whatever is most convenient for
              separators between the numbers.

              For an even more abbreviated way of entering move
              coordinates, enter them right on the initial command line
              along with the "M".  For example, use m6235 for quadrant 6,2
              sector 3,5 or use m35 to move to sector 3,5 within the
              current quadrant.  When using this method do not use any
              spaces, commas, etc. to separate the "m" and the coordinate
              numbers.

         MSGS:
              Often during a heated battle messages will come for you so
              fast that it's possible to miss some of them.  You can use
              this command to review the most recent messages that have
              appeared.  The newest messages will be displayed at first
              and you can use the up arrow and down arrow keys to scroll
              through the messages.  Hit the ESC key when done.

         ORBIT:
              Use this command to enter a standard orbit around a planet.
              This will allow the planet to be scanned for the presence of
              energium crystals and other things.  Once in orbit, you can
              use the LAND command to visit the planet surface.
  
         LASERS:
              Use this command to fire the laser banks.  The laser
              control officer will request instructions on firing at each
              enemy vessel in the quadrant.

         QUIT:
              Use this command to quit the game.  You can also save a game
              before you quit; see the SAVE command.
  
         RAY:
              This command fires the experimental death ray.  This is a
              very powerful weapon that will destroy every enemy ship in
              the whole quadrant...if it works.  If it doesn't work,
              there's no telling what may happen, since the technology is
              not yet completely understood.

         REPAIR:
              This command is a request to engineering to provide the
              state of repair of all ship systems.  Any systems that are
              damaged will include an estimated time to repair.
  
         SAVE:
              You can save your game so that you can come back and
              continue it later.  After saving, the game continues until
              you give the quit command.  You can only restore a saved
              game when first starting up; you will be asked if you want
              to restore a saved game right after you are asked if you
              want a briefing.  You select the name of the file that is to
              contain the saved game information.  Any valid MS-DOS file
              name can be used; just hit <Enter> to use the default name
              "egatrek.sav".
  
         SELF:
              If the situation becomes hopeless, use this command to self-
              destruct.  With any luck, you will at least take a few
              enemy ships along with you.
  
         SHUP:
              This command raises the shields.  Engineering will
              acknowledge when the shields are up, and the image of your
              ship on the short range scanner will change to yellow.  You
              can also use the up arrow key to issue this command.
  
         SHDN:
              This command lowers the shields.  Engineering will
              acknowledge, and the image of the ship on the short range
              scanner will return to white.  You can also use the down
              arrow key for this command.
  
         SND:
              Use this command at any time during the game to toggle sound
              on and off.  A message will flash briefly on the screen
              acknowledging the command.

         TORPEDO:
              You have three torpedo tubes available.  The torpedo control
              officer will request instructions on the number of torpedoes
              to fire and the sectors to fire them at.
  
         USE:
              Any miscellaneous objects that you find during the game,
              such as energium crystals mined from planets, can be used
              with this command.

         WARP:
              Use this command to inform engineering of the warp speed you
              require from the engines when moving between quadrants.
              Invalid warp speeds will be ignored.

              If you wish, you can include the warp factor on the command
              line.  For example, enter w5.2 to set the warp factor to
              5.2.
  
         BOSS:
              Argh!  The boss is coming, and he's going to catch you
              playing games again.  Hit Shift-F1 and you shell to MS-DOS.
              You can now do simple MS-DOS commands, but be careful that
              you do not run anything that changes the screen mode as
              when you return to EGATrek you must still be in graphics
              mode to be able to continue the game.  Simple commands like
              DIR should work fine.  When you're ready to return to the
              game, type 'EXIT'.  (If you *are* the boss, you didn't see
              this command; it's hidden by a cloaking device.)

       Please remember that EGATrek is not free software.  As with all
       Shareware you are expected to purchase it after you've given it
       a reasonable trial.

       The registration price for EGATrek is $15 (plus $2 shipping), for
       which you'll receive by return mail a copy of the latest version,
       and possibly another Shareware game to try out.

       A deluxe version of EGATrek is also available.  This includes a
       storage case, printed manual, quick reference card, plus the
       registered version of the game.  This version is available for
       $22 (plus $4 shipping).

       Outside North America please include $4 for shipping/handling on
       all orders.

       Orders from outside the U.S. should be in U.S. funds.  Using a
       credit card is probably the easiest way to do this, but postal
       money orders, cash or bank drafts drawn on U.S. banks are
       acceptable.  Eurocheques will not be accepted even if drafted
       in U.S. funds.

       If you live in the U.K. you can register through Nildram
       Software.  Please print the file UKORDER.TXT for an order form
       all ready to go or just send #12.95 to:
