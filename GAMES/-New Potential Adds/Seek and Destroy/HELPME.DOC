                      Common problems and solutions
=============================================================================

Running with WINDOWS
--------------------

Seek and Destroy does not work reliably under Windows.  Sound may not work
and you may get unexpected jerking in the scrolling.  For best results exit
Windows before running Seek and Destroy.

                     HOW TO BOOT YOUR COMPUTER CLEAN
=============================================================================
    
If you're having problems running Seek and Destroy, you might be able to
get it up and running by "Booting your computer clean".  By this, we mean
starting up your computer without loading all of the little memory managers
and device drivers that might interfere with the game.  It's a relatively
simple process, so please bear with us.

If you have DOS 5.0
-------------------

   Please skip this section if you have DOS 6.0 or later!
   You need to create a "boot disk" to allow you to start your computer
   without loading all the TSR's and memory managers that take away 
   memory.  Here's how.

   A. Put a blank disk in your A: drive and format it as a DOS disk.  (Don't
      do this in your B: drive - it won't work!)  To do this, type the
      following command:
      
      FORMAT A: /S

   B.  Wait while your computer formats the disk.
   C.  Label the disk "Boot Disk" and keep it handy.  You'll need this
       disk whenever you want to start Seek and Destroy.

   Now, you can reboot your computer and play Seek and Destroy:

   A.  Put the boot disk in your A: drive.
   B.  Restart your computer,  either by pressing CTRL-ALT-DELETE,  by
       hitting your reset button,  or by turning it on.
   C.  Wait while your computer boots from the boot disk.
   D.  After a little while, your computer will stop and give you the A>
       prompt.
   E.  Now change to your hard disk by typing "C:".
   F.  Go into the Seek and Destroy directory by typing "CD \GAMES\SEEK".
   G.  Begin by typing "SEEK".

If you have DOS 6.0 or later
----------------------------

   Reboot your computer by pressing RESET or Ctrl-Alt-Del.  Wait for the
   message "Starting MS-DOS..." to come up.  Now press the [F5] key.

   This will cause DOS 6.0 to bypass all of your TSR's, memory managers,
   and other programs which normally occupy main memory.

   Now change into the Seek and Destroy directory and begin the game.

                      GENERAL QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
=============================================================================

Q: When I run Seek and Destroy,  the game refuses to start and gives
   me the message "You do not have enough free memory."

A: To run Seek and Destroy,  you'll need:
   
   * At least 550K of free conventional memory
   * At least 2.5 Megs of other memory.
   
   Here's what you need to do:

   1. Make sure you have at least 4 megabytes of memory installed in your
   computer!  You'll need this much in order to have 2.5 Megs free.

   2. If you are trying to run Seek and Destroy from Windows, completely exit
   Windows and try running it from DOS.

   3. If you are trying to run Seek and Destroy from "DOSSHELL" or any other
   menu program,  please exit from the menu program.  Then, run Seek and
   Destroy from the DOS prompt.  Menu programs often occupy enough memory that
   there won't be enough left for the game.

   4. If none of the above help, you can solve this problem quickly by
   "Booting your computer clean".  See above for details!

Q: When I run Seek and Destroy, the computer locks up or reboots.
A: Run SETUP and verify that your settings are correct. If you are
   not using a sound card, make sure that SETUP is set for "No Sound Card".
   If you are using a sound card, verify that your sound card has no 
   address, IRQ, or DMA conflicts with other cards in your system.  If your 
   sound card works properly with other games, you can assume that there 
   are no conflicts.  However, if your sound card does not work with other 
   games,  you have a conflict.  See your sound card manual for details on 
   fixing this.

Q: Seek and Destroy runs slowly on my 386 or 486 computer.  What can I do?
A: Your computer or VGA card isn't as fast as the game would like.

   You can speed the game up by changing the detail to LOW for TERRAIN,
   OVERLAY and EXPLOSIONS in the options screen.  If you are desperate,
   you may want to set your sound card to NONE if you are using a Sound
   Blaster type card (this will speed the game up).

Q: While playing, I get dumped back to DOS with an error message
   "Error initializing sound"
A: This is probably caused by the lack of a sound.cfg file in the directory
   that Seek and Destroy was run from.  Usually, Seek and Destroy will run
   SETUP.EXE if no sound.cfg file is found.  If for some reason that failed
   then when the sound library tries to initialize it will not work.  In this
   case run SETUP.EXE manually. Make sure SETUP.EXE is in the same directory
   that you installed Seek and Destroy to (C:\GAMES\SEEK)

Q: While playing, I get dumped back to DOS with an error message
   "Error while loading XXXXXXX"
A: You have probably deleted one of the files needed by Seek and Destroy or
   The game was run from a directory where the data files weren't present.
   Re-install Seek and Destroy before running the game.

Q: I can't seem to get ANYTHING on the screen.  I type SEEK and the system
   "hangs".  What now?
A: Make sure your computer meets the system requirements mentioned earlier in
   the manual. If you do, you may have TSR's that conflict with Seek and
   Destroy.  Remove the TSR's and try running the game with a "clean boot"
   from a DOS diskette.

                           SOUND CARD NOTES
=============================================================================

   Since new models of sound cards are always being manufactured and revised,
   sometimes a new sound card will come out that's not compatible with
   Seek and Destroy.  To determine whether you are having a sound-related
   conflict, try setting up Seek and Destroy for "No Sound."  If Seek and
   Destroy works without sound, but locks up with sound on, chances are that
   you are having a sound-related conflict.

   Here's how to contact the top sound card makers for information about
   sound card problems and obtaining the latest driver files.
