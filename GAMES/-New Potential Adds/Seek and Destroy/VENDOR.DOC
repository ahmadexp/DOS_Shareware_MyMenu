                              Seek and Destroy
                Version 1.0 from Safari Software (Member ASP)
=============================================================================

DESCRIPTION:

Seek and Destroy is a carnage-filled military action game that puts you
behind the controls of a weapon-packed Apache helicopter or tank in the year
2008-10 years after the end of World War III. Your mission is to thwart the
plans of a menacing group of individuals building up a massive supply of
armaments in South America. The fate of the free world rests upon your skill
as Vehicular Combat Trooper. You will have to have nerves of steel,
unparalleled skill and reflexes, and fearless persistence to destroy the
threat of a fourth world war.

Seek and Destroy features five separate missions (two in the shareware), each
made up of four pulse-racing phases. Each mission will present you with a
unique, but always dangerous, objective. Some missions will involve no more,
or less, than the obliteration of key targets and weapons. Others will include
vital secondary objectives, including the rescue of prisoners and delicate
reconnaissance operations.

Whatever the mission, you will have to make full use of your combat vehicle's
tactical and destructive capabilities. Depending on the task at hand, you
will need to rely on either the mobility and speed of your chopper or the
sheer destructive force of your tank. You will have eight of the most
devastating weapons known to man to back you up on your missions plus six
(two in shareware) ultra-powerful special weapons for when the going gets
really tough. Considering that you will be under constant counter attack from
enemy aircraft and ground weapons, your going to need every ounce of firepower
you can get.

Seek and Destroy features a smooth 360-degree battlefield, fast-paced action,
multiple weapon upgrades and configurations, awesome explosions, and mass
destruction.
