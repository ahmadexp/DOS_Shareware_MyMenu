Welcome to Hugo's House of Horrors!

The story so far...
You are in total control of Hugo's
destiny as he searches the haunted
house for his sweetheart Penelope!
(She was last seen going into this
house on a baby-sitting assignment)

You may control Hugo's motion with
the arrow keys or keypad.  You may
also give him simple commands to
pick up or look at something which
catches your eye.  A very useful
phrase would be "open the door",
on the first screen, for example.
Others are "look" and "look at..."

On your travels, be on the lookout
for useful or valuable objects.
They may very well help you in your
quest for Penelope.  Keep your wits
about you, though, since not every-
thing is necessarily as it seems!

F9 is the "Boss Button" for people
who like to sneak in a game during
office hours!  It simply shells you
out to DOS.  You must hit EXIT to
rejoin your game.

This button will allow you to keep
a game going "in the background"
while you do your normal work in
its DOS shell!
