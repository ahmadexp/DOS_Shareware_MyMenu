HUGO II, WHODUNIT? ... It's adventure time again as HUGO and Penelope get
swept up in another superbly animated 3-D EGA extravaganza!  This time a
mystery is afoot with a couple of fiendish twists and a large helping of
humor along the way.  HUGO II, WHODUNIT? follows the same look and feel of
HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS but with many more screens and characters.

If you enjoyed the HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS, then HUGO II is a real treat in
store for you!

±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  6.1  START-UP PROCEDURE  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±

Start HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS by typing HHH.

The registered version allows you to add one or more switches as follows:
		HHH -s          Disables the sound
		HHH -r          Runs the program in RECORD mode
		HHH -p          Runs the program in PLAYBACK mode

To finish the game early, type either QUIT or EXIT at the prompt.





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  6.2  HOW TO PLAY  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±

To move HUGO, use either your arrow keys or the numeric keypad.  (Remember to
turn the Num-Lock off).  If using the keypad, diagonal movement is possible.

Use simple English to instruct HUGO to perform an action.  For example "look
around" or "look at door" to look at things.  To pick something up try "pick
up the gold" or "get gold" or "take gold".  Many synonyms are allowed but if
HUGO doesn't seem to understand, try re-phrasing your command.

Certain actions carry a bonus score when carried out, as does picking up
useful objects.  When you have successfully completed the game, your score
should match the maximum score shown on the status line at the top of the
screen.

If you have trouble solving some of the puzzles in this game, there is a
free hint booklet available.  This contains a range of hints, from cryptic
to obvious, for each room.  To obtain your hint booklet, simply follow the
directions in the readme file to register this program.

Registered users also receive a self-running version of the game (see section
on record and playback).





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  6.3  FUNCTION KEYS  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±

F1  ..........  Press once for a reminder of the other function keys.
		Press twice for help.


F2  ..........  TURNS SOUND ON OR OFF.  Note that sound does not play
		continuously.  The status of this button is shown in the
		status line at the top of the screen.


F3  ..........  REPEATS LAST COMMAND.  This key is useful to allow you to
		repeat a command or edit the last command.


F4  ..........  SAVES A GAME. If you have to leave the game early but wish to
		save your current position, use this feature by pressing F4.

		You will see a text box appear with eight rows of dotted lines
		and an arrow pointing to the first.  These are empty "slots"
		which allow you to save up to eight versions of the game.
		Press return and the arrow will flash by the first slot,
		prompting you to enter a short description of your current
		game, e.g. "In the Kitchen", press return to save the game and
		then either continue or leave the game by typing QUIT or EXIT.

		When you return to run the game again, use the F5 button to
		restore it.  You may re-use any slot and either retain the
		same description or type another.


F5  ..........  RESTORE A PREVIOUSLY SAVED GAME.  Select a "slot" as described
		in function F4.  Note you may not select an empty slot !  Hit
		return to restore the game.


F6  ..........  INVENTORY.  Pressing F6 puts up a text box to show you what
		objects you are currently carrying.


F9  ..........  BOSS BUTTON.  So-named because it instantly removes all traces
		of the game from the screen and places you in a normal DOS
		environment from which you can perform your regular work-like
		commands.  Note, however, that the game is still lurking unseen
		in the background and the amount of memory available to you is
		reduced by about 280Kb.  Resume your game at the next opportune
		moment by typing EXIT.





±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±  6.4  RECORD AND PLAYBACK  ±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±±

The registered version of the game includes record and playback modes.  This
effectively allows you to construct a self-running version of the game and a
sample playback file is included which runs right through the game from start
to finish, achieving the maximum score possible.

To run this playback file, make sure the supplied PLAYBACK.DAT file is in the
same directory as your registered version of the game and type: HHH -p

This self-running game might be suitable for, say, a child who is too young
to play the game but can watch the game like a story.  To disable the sound
during the playback, type: HHH -p -s

To record your own game, start the program by typing: HHH -r   Note that this
will create a file PLAYBACK.DAT which will overwrite any previous file of
that name, including the one supplied.  If you wish to save a previous
PLAYBACK.DAT, copy it to another directory or rename it.

Some points to watch when recording are:
þ  When a text box appears on the screen, it will stay up for a period of time
   which depends on how much text there is to read.  When the time is up, the
   program beeps to let you know you can continue.  This is because during
   playback, there should be no manual intervention.
þ  Don't try to use the Save and Restore features, this would require manual
   intervention during playback.
þ  The same goes for the BOSS button.
þ  You may use the F1, F2, F3, F6 buttons during recording.





²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²  7.  PROGRAM SELF-CHECK  ²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²²

HUGO'S HOUSE OF HORRORS provides a measure of protection for itself against
accidental corruption during downloads from bulletin boards.  A self-check is
performed when the program starts up and will notify the user upon failure.
Note that the program must be run from the directory where it resides or the
self-check will fail.
