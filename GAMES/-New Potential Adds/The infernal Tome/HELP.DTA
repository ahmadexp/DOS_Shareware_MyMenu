Select             New Game from the Main Menu, and then Select                START.  For those who like to create their own              characters, read further.                                                                                              -                 CHARACTER CREATION                         You can create new characters every time you                select NEW GAME from the Main Menu.  From the               NEW GAME you may select START a new game,                   LOAD characters from a previous game, edit                  a character, or EXIT back to the Main menu.                                                                             Character's traits are divided into two                     categories: ATTRIBUTES and TRAINING.                                                                                    ATTRIBUTES are those abilities that are                     dictated by a character's race.  They are                   inborn and cannot change.  Attributes range                 from 0 (none at all) to 20 (superhuman).                    Depending on the attributes values, you                     will be allowed to enter certain professions                with your character.  These attributes include:                                                                         Intelligence - Self explanatory.  The                       intelligence of a character is a primary                    trait for wizards.                                                                                                      Strength - Strong characters can hit harder                 and carry more weight.  Strength is primary                 for barbarians, and secondary for paladins.                                                                             Piety - How devout is your character?  Piety                is the essential trait for a cleric, and to a               lesser extent for paladins.                                                                                             Coordination - The eye-hand coordination of                 the character, fundamental for a thief.                                                                                 In addition to these 4 primary traits,                      there are two other traits that are just                    as important,  governing how your character                 reacts.                                                                                                                 Speed - how quickly a character regains the                 use of his hands once he strikes in battle.                                                                             Hit Points - The amount of damage your character            can take before he dies.                                                                                                When you are creating your character, you are               allowed a certain number of attribute "BONUS                POINTS ".  These range from 0-2 and may be                  distributed across the character's abilities to             customize the character as you wish.  You are               only awarded attribute points during                        character creation.                                                                                                     TRAINING reflects the areas in which a character            has been trained. Although partially influenced             by ATTRIBUTES (i.e. a character cannot possess more         skill than he has the innate ability for), these            skills can grow as the character moves through              the game.                                                                                                               Trained skills include:                                                                                                 Locks/Traps - Skill in picking locks and disarming          traps.  Should be at least a 6.                                                                                         Scribing - The ability to recognize artifacts.              Without this ability, the party may unintentionally         injure himself or others through the incorrect              use of an object.  A '6' in this category gives             the party the ability to read all languages,                including Grimhaden, Dryaden, High Voranu,                  and Shadowen.                                                                                                           Weapons - How your character handles contact                and range weapons and shields.                                                                                          Water       - Training in water magic.                                                                                  Earth       - Training in earth magic.                                                                                  Air         - Training in magic of the air.                                                                             Fire        - Training in fire magic.                                                                                   As with ATTRIBUTES, you have from 0-2 Bonus                 points to customize the character.  Unlike                  ATTRIBUTES, you get additional training                     points for every 100, 150, or 200 valor points              (depending upon the play level you select)                  until your character becomes a 10th level                   character.                                                                                                             -Character Condition                                         During the game, your characters will encounter             traps and different monsters. During these                  encounters your character will sometimes become             hampered. The characters' current                           conditions are represented by small icons on the            game play screen next to the characters' faces.             These icons include: a skull for death, a green             face for poisoned, a ZZZZ symbol to indicate                a stun or paralysis, and a ??? symbol to                    indicate a confused character.                                                                                          A stunned or paralyzed character will awaken                after a day's rest. During that day, he                     can perform no action. The condition can be                 lifted with an Awaken spell.                                                                                            A confused character will only perform the action           asked of him approximately 50% of the time. A               day's rest will cure confusion.                                                                                         A  poisoned character will remain poisoned until            either a cure poison spell is cast, or a cure               poison potion is found (or made) and administered.          Poisoned characters wil tire more easily and                will be damaged more severely during combat.                                                                            A dead character may be revived through a Raise             The Dead spell, or by the administering of a                Raise The Dead potion. The magic mirror in the              garden in game 1 can also raise a dead character to         life again.                                                                                                            -                  THE PROFESSIONS                           There are 6 professions.  There are certain                 minimum attribute points required to enter                  each profession.  Each profession provides                  training in certain areas.  The professions are:                                                                        Barbarian - Extremely capable with weapons, but             lacking any ability at all with magic, barbarians           are the perfect fighting machine.  To enter the             Barbarian profession a character must have a                strength of at least 13.  Barbarians are highly             trained in the use of weapons and have a little             skill in the use of lock picks and traps.                                                                               Paladin - Paladins are holy knights, trained in             the use of the healing arts as well as the use of           weapons.  To enter the Paladin profession, a                character must have at least a 10 in both piety             and strength.                                                                                                           Wizards - Wizards are highly intelligent and                extremely well trained in all forms of magic                (but hold some disregard for the healing magic              of water).  The primary trait for wizards is                intelligence.  A character must have at least               an intelligence level of 13 to be a Wizard.                                                                             Rogue - Rogues are jacks of all trades, and masters         of none.  Unlike the skilled professions, Rogues            have picked up their training on the street,                learning a little of every skill.  A Rogue is               a valuable addition to any party lacking in several         skills.                                                                                                                 Clerics - Clerics are highly trained in the art of          healing.  A cleric's primary ability is his                 skill in water magic.  A character must have at             least an 11 in piety to enter the cleric profession.                                                                    Thief - Thieves are highly trained in the art of            manipulating locks and traps.  Without a thief              your characters are more likely to jam most                 locks and set off most traps.  A thief needs                a minimum of 12 in coordination to become                   a thief.                                                                                                               -                  GENDER                                    In addition to attributes and training,                     two other factors are important - these are                 gender and race.  A male character has an                   additional rating point for strength, while                 a female character has an additional rating                 point for coordination.  Males lose a rating                point for coordination; females lose a point                for strength.                                                                                                          -                 THE RACES                                  There are four races among the Voranu (the people           of Garon).  These races include:                                                                                        Human - Good at most everything, exceptional at             nothing.  Little resistance to magic.                              Intelligence 7-14                                           Strength 9-15                                               Piety 10-14                                                 Coordination 7-11                                           Hit Points 70-90                                            Speed 3-6                                                                                                        Grimhaden - Poor at magic, excellent strength and           stamina. Good resistance to magic.

Without characters skilled in the use of             magic, your efforts will be doomed to failure,              therefore a short discussion in magic is in order.                                                                      There are 4 kinds of magic.                                                                                               Air spells are spells that manipulate the                   environment, such as 'Knock Knock' (opens                   locked doors) and Eagle Eye                                 (Views a larger area of the map).                                                                                       Earth spells are those of the physical realm,               such as Ice Storm, and HOLD.                                                                                            Water spells are healing spells, such as                    'Balm of P'Tah'.                                                                                                        Fire spells are attack spells, such as                      Fireball, and Inferno's Blast.                                                                                          Spells are learned in 3 different ways.                     When you create a character, you will be                    prompted to select a spell the character has                magic for in each category.                                                                                             Likewise when the character gains a level                   (every 150,250, or 400 valor points) you will again         be asked. Current valor points, and the points              required to go to the next level can be viewed              on the character's profile, brought up by hitting           F1-F4, or clicking with the left mouse key on               the character's face.                                                                                                   Finally, in the maze are magic scrolls which                will impart 1 spell of a certain magic type.                                                                         - Play level                                                   When you first start TOME, the game will ask                you for the play level. Depending upon the                  level you select monsters will die harder,                  and be more prone to invoke special attacks.                It will also be harder to advance your                      characters as you select harder levels.                                                                                                                                          -                    PLAYING THE GAME                       -Manipulating characters                                     Along the edges of the play field are the characters'       faces.  Below each face is shown what they are              carrying in each hand.  Beside the character's face         are three bar graphs showing their vitality, stamina,       and magic strength.  Each graph ranges                      from 0-100%.                                                                                                            Vitality represents the character's life energy.            When a character's vitality is less than 5, he              falls asleep.  When a character's vitality is 0,            he is dead.                                                                                                             Stamina represents the character's constitution             (how quickly e will recover).  If a character's             stamina is less than 50%, he will not strike as             hard, nor recover as quickly.                                                                                           Magic represents the character's magic strength.            As a character's magic strength falls, he is                capable of casting fewer kinds of spells.                                                                               To select a character, to view his vital signs              or see what's in their inventory, click the mouse           on the character's face, or hit F1-F4.                                                                                  To use an item in the character's hand, select              the hand with the left mouse, or click 1/2 for              left/right character 1, 3/4 for                             left/right character 2, etc. If you wish to                 take an object out of a character's hand, or                want to exchange an object for the object                   being carried by the mouse, click on the hand               with the right mouse button.                                                                                           -Objects                                                     Tome is an interactive game. As you go through the          game, if you wish to try to use an object in the game       click with the left mouse on the object or bit of           scenery. Typical examples are the library shelves.          Click on them to search the shelves for scrolls             or books. Click on buttons to open doors and                invoke different things.                                                                                                                                                           -The Skull                                                   Above the viewing area is a skull. The skull's eyes         will glow when you encounter a trap you have already        identified. Clicking the left mouse on the skull's          head (or hitting the Q key) and you can ask questions       about things within TOME. Try asking the skull about        Tenis.                                                                                                                 - Firesticks                                                  Throughout the maze are powerful weapons called             firesticks. These invoke up to 100 points of damage         upon a monster. These can be recharged by the spinning      skulls. Hold the firestick up against a spinning skull      and click the right mouse will recharge the weapon.                                                                   -Movement                                                    Movement is accomplished by clicking on the                 arrows below the 3D viewing area with the mouse,            or using the numeric keypad.                                                                                           -Radar View                                                  In the left lower corner of the screen is a                 radar view showing the area immediately around              you.  This view is especially helpful, since it             shows the current state of all doors, levers, etc.                                                                     -Manipulating objects                                        There are several ways to manipulate objects                within TOME.  Using the right mouse key on the              display screen, or hitting                                  the 'W' key will 'work' objects such as                     locks, levers, and buttons.  Clicking the left              mouse key, or hitting 'G/D' will pick up                    and drop objects.  If you have picked up an                 object, hitting the 'P' key will pitch (throw).                                                                         If you are on a character's inventory screen,               you may still Get and Drop objects. Use the right           mouse button to 'use' an object. Use the left               mouse button to exchange an object in the inventory         bag for what is being carried by the mouse.                                                                            -Icon Menu                                                   The Icon menu is located in the lower right-                hand corner of the screen.  There are 7 icons.                                                                          ? bring up this help text.                                                                                              Selecting the wizard, or hitting 'S' will                   allow you to cast a spell in one of the four                categories - Water, Earth, Air, or Fire.                                                                               -(spell casting)                                             Hit S or select wizard on icon menu.  Select                spellcaster.  Move through the spells in                    the spellbook by clicking the mouse on                      the left/right hand edged of the book, or                   hit W,A,F,or E (for Water/Air/Fire/Earth).                  Spells that the magician knows and has the                  strength for are presented.  Use the up down                arrows to select or click on the spell with                 the mouse.  The spell will be cast.  In the Keep            are special gems called 'T'Ganths'.  T'Ganths               act as focusing gems that will boost                        the power of a magic user if held while casting.            Locating these will make your magicians much                more lethal.                                                                                                            There is a shortcut to casting spells. Click with           the right mouse key on the character face will              bring up the spell book for that character with             the last page used displayed.                                                                                          -(checking time of day)                                      Selecting the Timer, or hitting 'T' will                    display the time of day.                                                                                               -(examining items)                                           Selecting the Eyeball , or hitting 'X' will                 cause your characters to examine the space in               front of them.  Many objects throughout TOME are            trapped.  Before a trap can be disarmed, you must           examine the object to find the trap.  (Another way          to find the trap is to use the object                       and have the trap explode in your face).                                                                               -(options)                                                   Selecting the Diskette, or hitting ESC will                 bring up the options menu.  This menu allows                saving/loading/exiting, swapping character                  positions, and re-configuring your sound                    options.                                                                                                               -(resting)                                                   Selecting the camp fire will rest your characters.          During rest, stunned characters will awaken, and            tired ones will re-gain stamina, vitality, and              magic strength.                                                                                                        -(disarming traps)                                           Selecting the safe icon, or hitting 'D' will give           opportunity to disarm a trap that has been found            by stumbling into it, or through examination.                                                                          -Doors                                                       Doors are opened with levers, with buttons                  with a key, with a token and by working                     combination locks.  When opening a combination              lock, it is easy to 'jam it'.  Using characters             skilled at picking locks will help.  Once a door            is jammed, you must either use a 'Knock-Knock'              spell, or find a way around the door.                                                                                  -Buttons and levers                                          Throughout the game there are many buttons                  and levers.  These items might affect                       something anywhere else in the maze.                                                                                   -Battling Monsters                                           Keep your front characters armed and strong.                If they are weakening, don't hesitate to                    use a 'Balm of P'Tah', or even switch their                 position with another character.  Use attack                spells often.  If necessary, try backing up                 right after you have struck (this will give                 your characters a chance to recover their                   hands).  Remember that certain monsters                     are immune to certain types of magic.                                                                                   You have some control over 'how' your                       characters react in battle.  The character                  profile has two entries, Thrust/Swing and                   Dodge/Guard.  Use the A/D keys or click on them             with the mouse.  Thrust means a quick forward               thrust with the weapon.  This results in only               a 60% chance of hitting, but does double damage.            Swing means swinging the weapon in a broad arc.             This results in a 90% chance of hitting the                 enemy and does normal damage.  Dodge means the              character ducks.  Guard means the character stands          his ground, and tries to hit back.                                                                                     -                        MONSTERS                            Following is a brief list of some of the                    creatures of TOME.  Armor class represents the              chance the monster will absorb your blow.  Hit              points represents the amount of vitality of                 that monster.  Watch out for monsters with                  special attacks! Some monsters will drop items              when they are destroyed.
