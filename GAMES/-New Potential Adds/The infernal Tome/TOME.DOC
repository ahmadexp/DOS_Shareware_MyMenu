                   The Infernal Tome
               Episode 1: Shardmoure Keep
              Shareware Evaluation Version
               Copyright 1996 Don Lemons
               An MVP Software Production

Welcome to The Infernal Tome, a fantasy/role-playing adventure game.
In Tome you will encounter strange creatures and bizarre situations,
as you explore Shardmoure Keep below the world of Garon.  You will
be called upon to solve puzzles, defeat enemies, all the while
keeping your party of four alive and healthy.

If you've never played a role-playing game before, here are a few
general hints.  First, pick up everthing you can find.  When you
encounter a new area, search it thoroughly.  Second, save your game
often.  In Tome you will meet up with some fearsome monsters.  While
there are ways your party can recover even from the fiercest attack,
you may want to go back to a saved game sometimes.  Tome lets you
save many games at different stages.  Third, look carefully at
messages you are given.  Often they are clues that are necessary to
solve the game's puzzles.

In Tome you will lead a party of four characters.  While you can
choose your characters and give them characteristics and abilities
of your choosing, it is best to play the game for a while first with
the default characters to get a feel for what is needed.  Tome
allows you to jump right in and start playing, but it also gives
veteran RPG players the flexibility to choose almost everything
about their party.

Finally, read this entire manual.  In fact, print it out and keep it
handy while you are playing the game.  It contains a lot of valuable
information.

This game is shareware.  You may freely try it.  If you like it or
find it useful, then you must register with MVP Software.  To
"register" a shareware game means to purchase it directly from the
developer.  (Shareware games are evaluation versions only, which
means you have the right to try them, but after trying them you must
either register them with the author or delete them from your
system.  It is unlikely that anyone will check up on you, so
shareware works because of the honesty of users.)  When you register

   * A hint book and manual written by the author that will help get
     you through those tough spots.
   * Cheat codes for party power-ups, healing and kill monsters.
   * An auto-map so you can tell where you've been in the Keep and

                       The Story So Far . . .

In a future time, science has become as magic.  In this time two
scientists, Peter and Bartholomew, created the ultimate spell that
could stop time itself.  To protect their work, they recorded it in
a mysterious book they named the Infernal Tome, and they created a
world, named Garon, and stored the Tome in its fiery depths.  They
populated Garon with a race of beings called the Draden.

But sadly, these two scientists argued.  Their disagreement resulted
in a cataclysmic battle, ending with Peter banishing Bartholomew
into the depths of Garon.

Eventually the Draden evolved into 4 races -- Dryadens, Grimhadens,
Humans, and Halflings.  These races only faintly remembered their
creators, now named P'Tah and B'Nah.

As the years passed the races formed the High Council.  The first
Lord of the High Council, Lord Tenis, governed the races with an
iron hand.  In his half-awakened state B'Nah offered Tenis the gift
of ultimate power, if he would but submit his will.  Tenis succumbed
to this temptation, but in the madness of the power, he killed his
consort, the Lady Ganryn.

In his anger, Tenis took upon himself the name of the King of
Shadows.  To honor his vow to B'Nah, he built Shardmoure Keep to
protect the entrance to B'Nah's resting place, but in vengeance he
allowed no one access to B'Nah's crypt.

The ShadowKing has discovered and started to unravel the secrets of
the Infernal Tome.  The priests of P'Tah have commanded you and your
party to venture forth into Shardmoure and wrest the Tome from his
grasp.  And thus it begins...

My-Fetu's Diary
---------------
I am My-Fetu born sired of Calatus, of the clan of the ShadowWeaven,
of the race of Halfling, of the people named Voranu.  These are the
chronicles of my participation in the quest to free the Tome from
the clutches of the Dead Lord.

   Day 1
   -----
I was summoned by messenger to report to the priests of temple P'Tah
in my home haven of Enu.  An acolyte loomed before me at the
vestibule and issued me to the chamber of the high priest S'Tak and
bid me sit.

As my eyes became accustomed to the gloom I made out the shadowy
figure of S'Tak, his snowy white beard glowing faintly.  I advanced
towards him but drew up short as he held up a single gnarled finger.
I was frozen, my breath caught in my throat.

He finished his ruminations and raised a wizened face towards me.  A
single brow shot up.  "So this is what the race of Halfling has to
offer," he said.  "Ah well, the foundation of a building cannot be
judged from it's entrance."  He lowered his finger and I was
released.

"The future of the Voranu rests upon the shoulders of you and your
party," he said.  "The danger is grave.  You must proceed to
Shardmoure Keep, on the northern reaches of the Bright Lands.
Waiting there will be the Dead Lord with his minion, the King of
Shadows."

I protested.  "The Dead Lord is but a myth used to frighten the
young," I said.  "Tell me not of fantasies."

"QUIET!" roared the druid master.  "Forsooth, I tell you now in
truth.  This generation has much to learn of the Time of Legends.
The age of childhood is passed."

I protested more, but to little avail.  Now I and my three
companions find ourselves journeying to the northern reaches, our
wallets containing letters of writ drawing upon the coffers of the
order of P'Tah.

   Day 12
   ------
This day we have reached the Dragonspine, the home of the Grimhaden,
the squat softspoken masters of the stone.  The race of the
Grimhaden are taciturn, tending to themselves, their attitudes
doubtless brought on by the cold starkness of their mountain
retreats.  This was a time to rest our weary bodies and replenish
our stores.  P'Tor, the blunt warrior of our traveling party, seemed
at peace among the lands of his people.  We presented our letters of
writ with little use.  The Grimhaden pay scant attention to those
they deem lesser among Voranu.  Only the agreements of the Accord
Codex ensure that they abide by the rule of the High Council.  If
not for P'Tor drawing upon the favors of his extended family we
would have gone hungry.

   Day 15
   ------
We crossed into the forests of Dryaden.  The Dryaden are a quiet
race, looking down imperiously on those not of their kind.  From my
time with Nandori however, I know that they have a humorous streak,
which they strive to keep hidden from the others of the Voranu.

As we crossed the Solemn river, we surprised a Dark Monk.  The
follower of darkness glared and cast a single firebolt that singed
my tunic.  Another flash paralyzed P'Tor, placing him under a Hold
Spell.  I muttered a quick release spell, freeing him to wreak havoc
with his short sword.  We made short work of the monk after that,
suffering only minor wounds.

   Day 19
   ------
We have finished our northern trek to the gates of ShardMoure Keep.
After dealing with the Ogre guard positioned at the entrance, we
have made our way inside.  The entrance has closed behind us.  We
have but one way in which we can travel, forward into the gloom....

Thus far the reading of the diary of My-Fetu.

               Installation of The Infernal Tome

If you downloaded this file from a BBS or online service,
installation is simple.  First, make sure you are out of Windows
completely.  Next, unarchive the files into a directory on your hard
drive.  Then type TOME and press ENTER.  That's all there is to it!
If the game doesn't load, read the next section.

Once Tome is loaded, the first thing you will see is a configuration
screen for customizing the sound and music on your system.  Move the
slide bars on this screen to change the volume levels of the sound
and music to your taste.

System Requirements and Troubleshooting
---------------------------------------
The Infernal Tome requires a 386 or higher processor, at least 4 meg
RAM, 550 free conventional RAM, and a VGA graphics card and monitor.
A mouse and sound card are recommended.  If Tome doesn't load when
you try to play the game, it will probably give you an error message
indicating that your system doesn't have enough available memory for
the program to run.

To solve this problem, first go back to the DOS prompt.  Then type
MEMMAKER and press ENTER.  Memmaker is a DOS utility that will
organize your computer's memory more efficiently.  Accept the
default settings in Memmaker, running it in "Express Setup," and
telling it that you need "No EMS", or expanded memory.  Expanded
memory is an old an inefficient way of organizing memory in excess
of 1 meg.

Memmaker will reboot your computer a few times.  When it is
finished, it will give you a report on the additional memory it has
freed up.  It should say that your system has at least 550k free
conventional RAM and 2 meg XMS (extended memory).

If you have run Memmaker and you still get the insufficient memory
message when you try to run Tome, load your CONFIG.SYS file into a
text editor and put the word "rem" in front of the line in which you
see "EMM386", and reboot your computer.  (If you don't know how to
do this you shouldn't be messing with this setting on your computer
anyway, so I would rather not say much more about this.)  Another
option is to purchase QEMM 8, a third-party memory manager that is
far superior to EMM386, which comes with DOS.

Here are some other command-line settings you can use to load Tome
if you experience other difficulties.  To invoke any of these,
load the game by typing TOME /<option>, where <option> refers to
any of the three following choices.  (Don't type the brackets when
you use any of these.)

/CFG - Normally, TOME does not ask your system configuration at the
       outset after the first time you play it.  To force TOME to
       present the configuration menu, use this option.

/LOW - For computers with slower VGA boards or CPUs, the /LOW switch
       will turn off some of the game display detail.  This will not
       impact the game's playability, just some of the finer graphic
       details.

/NOSB - In certain instances, TOME may mistakenly detect a Sound
        Blaster board.  This can cause the game to crash.  Using
        this option will force TOME to configure itself for the PC
        speaker.

At any time during the game, you may press the ? key to bring up
either a help file or My-Fetu's diary.

Another common problem with DOS games is that the mouse driver may
not be loaded.  If your mouse doesn't work with the game, this is
why.  A mouse driver is a piece of software that allows DOS programs
to communicate with the hardware.  It is normally called MOUSE.EXE
or MOUSE.COM.  For your mouse to work with Tome you must find and
run this program first.  If you don't know where it is, contact the
company from whom you purchased your computer.  A properly setup
system will load the mouse driver automatically upon bootup.


                       The People of Garon

Welcome to TOME, a multi-character fantasy role-playing trilogy.
Within TOME, you will take your party of characters into the depths
of Shardmoure Keep, home of the ShadowKing.  To successfully win the
game, you will have to solve puzzles, find important items, learn
the art of combat, and deal with villains such as the Keeper, the
dead lord B'Nah, and the ShadowKing himself.

Quick Start
-----------
TOME comes preloaded with four characters who have a healthy spread
of abilities.  If you would like to play the game using these four
characters, select New Game from the Main Menu, and then Select
START.  For those who like to create their own characters, read on.

Character Creation
------------------
You can create new characters every time you select NEW GAME from
the Main Menu.  From the NEW GAME you may select START a new game,
LOAD characters from a previous game, edit a character, or EXIT back
to the Main menu.

A character's traits are divided into two categories: ATTRIBUTES and
TRAINING.

ATTRIBUTES are those abilities that are dictated by a character's
race.  They are inborn and cannot change.  Attributes range from 0
(none at all) to 20 (superhuman).  Depending on the attributes'
values possessed by a character, that character can enter certain
professions.  These attributes include:

   Intelligence - Self explanatory.  The intelligence of a character
                  is a primary trait for wizards.

   Strength - Strong characters can hit harder and carry more
              weight.  Strength is primary for barbarians, and
              secondary for paladins.

   Piety - How devout is the character?  Piety is an essential trait
           for a cleric, and to a lesser extent for paladins.

   Coordination - The eye-hand coordination of the character,
                  fundamental for a thief.

In addition to the these four primary traits, there are two other
traits that are just as important, governing how your character
reacts.

   Speed - How quickly a character regains the use of his hands once
           he strikes in battle.

   Hit Points - The amount of damage a character can take before
                s/he dies.

When you create your character, you are allowed a certain number of
attribute "BONUS POINTS." These range from 0-2 and may be
distributed across the character's abilities to customize the
character as you wish.  You are only awarded attribute points during
character creation.

TRAINING reflects the areas in which a character has been trained.
Although partially influenced by ATTRIBUTES (i.e., a character
cannot possess more skill than he has the innate ability for), these
skills can grow as the character moves through the game.

Trained skills include:

   Locks/Traps - Skill in picking locks and disarming traps.  Should
                 be at least a 6.

   Scribing - The ability to recognize artifacts.  Without this
              ability, a character may unintentionally injure
              himself or others through the incorrect use of an
              object.  A '6' in this category gives the party the
              ability to read all languages, including Grimhaden,
              Dryaden, High Voranu, and Shadowen.

   Weapons - How your character handles contact and range weapons
             and shields.

   Water - Training in water magic.

   Earth - Training in earth magic.

   Air - Training in magic of the air.

   Fire - Training in fire magic.

As with ATTRIBUTES, you have from 0-2 Bonus points to customize the
character.  Unlike ATTRIBUTES, you get additional training points
for every 100, 150, or 200 valor points (depending upon the play
level you select) until your character becomes a 10th level

character.  Not all characters need to be proficient in all areas,
of course, but your party should have a wide range of attributes and
training.

Character Condition
-------------------
During the game your characters will encounter traps and different
monsters.  During these encounters your character will sometimes
become hampered.  The characters' current conditions are represented
by small icons on the game play screen next to the their faces.

These icons include: a skull for death, a green face for poisoned, a
ZZZZ symbol to indicate a stun or paralysis, and a ???  symbol to
indicate a confused character.

A stunned or paralyzed character will awaken after a day's rest.
During that day, he can perform no action.  The condition can be
lifted with an Awaken spell.

A confused character will only perform the action asked of him
approximately 50% of the time.  A day's rest will cure confusion.

A poisoned character will remain poisoned until either a cure poison
spell is cast, or a cure poison potion is found (or made) and
administered.  Poisoned characters wil tire more easily and will be
damaged more severely during combat.

A dead character may be revived through a Raise The Dead spell, or
by the administering of a Raise The Dead potion.  The magic mirror
in the garden in episode one can also raise a dead character to life
again.

The Professions
---------------
There are six professions.  There are certain minimum attribute
points required to enter each profession.  Each profession provides
training in certain areas.  The professions are:

   Barbarian - Extremely capable with weapons, but lacking any
               ability at all with magic, barbarians are the perfect
               fighting machine.  To enter the barbarian profession
               a character must have a strength of at least 13.
               Barbarians are highly trained in the use of weapons
               and have a little skill in the use of lock picks and
               traps.

   Paladin - Paladins are holy knights, trained in the use of the
             healing arts as well as the use of weapons.  To enter
             the paladin profession, a character must have at least
             a 10 in both piety and strength.

   Wizards - Wizards are highly intelligent and extremely well
             trained in all forms of magic (but hold some disregard
             for the healing magic of water).  The primary trait for
             wizards is intelligence.  A character must have at
             least an intelligence level of 13 to be a Wizard.

   Rogue - Rogues are jacks of all trades, and masters of none.
           Unlike the skilled professions, Rogues have picked up
           their training on the street, learning a little of every
           skill.  A Rogue is a valuable addition to any party
           lacking in several skills.

   Clerics - Clerics are highly trained in the art of healing.  A
             cleric's primary ability is his skill in water magic.
             A character must have at least an 11 in piety to enter
             the cleric profession.

   Thief - Thieves are highly trained in the art of manipulating
           locks and traps.  Without a thief your characters are
           likely to jam most locks and set off most traps.  A
           character needs a minimum of 12 in coordination to become
           a thief.
                             
Gender
------
In addition to attributes and training, two other factors are
important.  These are gender and race.  A male character has an
additional rating point for strength, while a female character has
an additional rating point for coordination.  Males lose a rating
point for coordination; females lose a point for strength.

The Races
---------
There are four races among the Voranu (the people of Garon).  These
races include:

   Human - Good at most everything, exceptional at nothing.  Little
           resistance to magic.

      Intelligence 7-14
      Strength 9-15
      Piety 10-14
      Coordination 7-11
      Hit Points 70-90
      Speed 3-6

   Grimhaden - Poor at magic, excellent strength and stamina.  Good
               resistance to magic.

      Intelligence 6-12
      Strength 12-18
      Piety 2-6
      Coordination 9-13
      Hit Points 80-120
      Speed 1-4

   Dryads - Somewhat weaker than humans, good in in intelligence,
            coordination, and hand speed.  Some resistance to magic.

      Intelligence 8-15
      Strength 8-13
      Piety 8-10
      Coordination 10-15
      Hit Points 50-70
      Speed 5-8

   Halflings - The weakest sorts physically, but the most skilled at
               all types of magic.  Excellent resistance to magic.
               The most coordinated of the four races of the Voranu.
 
      Intelligence 9-18
      Strength 7-12
      Piety 10-16
      Coordination 9-17
      Hit Points 40-60
      Speed 7-10

Magic Within Tome
-----------------
Magic is very important within the world of TOME.  Without
characters skilled in the use of magic, your efforts will be doomed
to failure, therefore a short discussion in magic is in order.

There are 4 kinds of magic.

   Air spells are spells that manipulate the environment, such as
   'Knock Knock' (opens locked doors) and Eagle Eye (Views a larger
   area of the map).

   Earth spells are those of the physical realm, such as Ice Storm,
   and HOLD.

   Water spells are healing spells, such as 'Balm of P'Tah'.

   Fire spells are attack spells, such as Fireball, and Inferno's
   Blast.

Spells can be learned in 3 different ways.  When you create a
character, you will be prompted to select a spell for which the
character has magic in each category.

Likewise when the character gains a level (every 150, 250, or 400
valor points) you will again be asked.  Current valor points, and
the points required to go to the next level can be viewed on the
character's profile, brought up by hitting F1-F4, or clicking with
the left mouse key on the character's face.

Finally, in the maze are magic scrolls that will impart one spell of
a certain magic type.

Play level
----------
When you first start TOME, the game will ask you for the play level.
On the harder levels, monsters will be more difficult to kill and
will be more prone to invoke special attacks.  It will also be
harder to advance your characters as you select harder levels.


                  Playing The Infernal Tome

Manipulating Characters
-----------------------
Along the edges of the play field are the characters' faces.  Below

each face is shown what they are carrying in each hand.  Next to the
characters' face are three bar graphs showing their vitality,
stamina, and magic strength.  Each graph ranges from 0-100%.

Vitality represents the character's life energy.  When a character's
vitality is less than 5, he falls asleep.  When a character's
vitality is 0, he is dead.

Stamina represents the character's constitution (how quickly he will
recover).  If a character's stamina is less than 50%, he will not
strike as hard nor recover as quickly.

Magic represents the character's magic strength.  As a character's
magic strength falls, he is capable of casting fewer kinds of
spells.

Spellcasting Shortcut
---------------------
There is a shortcut to spell casting.  Select the character with the
'right' mouse button will go straight to the spell book,
pre-selected to the last page that the character used.

To select a character, to view his vital signs or see what's in his
inventory, click the mouse on the character's face, or hit F1-F4.

To use an item in a character's hand, select the hand with the left
mouse, or click 1/2 for left/right character 1, 3/4 for left/right
character 2, etc.  Click with the right mouse key to take an object
out of a character's hand, or to exchange the mouse object with the
object in the character's hand.

The Skull
---------
Above the viewing area is a skull.  The skull's eyes will glow when
you encounter a trap you have already identified.  Clicking the left
mouse on the skull's head (or hit the Q key) and the skull will
allow you to ask a question about the world of Garon.  Try asking
the skull about Tenis.

Firesticks
----------
Throughout the maze are powerful weapons called firesticks.  These
invoke up to 100 points of damage upon a monster.  These can be
recharged by the spinning skulls.  Hold the firestick up against a
spinning skull and click the right mouse button to recharge the
weapon.

Movement
--------
Movement is accomplished by clicking on the arrows below the 3D
viewing area with the mouse, or using the numeric keypad.

Radar View
----------
In the left lower corner of the screen is a radar view showing the
area immediately around you.  This view is especially helpful, since
it shows the current state of all doors, levers, etc.

Manipulating Objects
--------------------
There are several ways to manipulate objects within TOME.  Using the
right mouse button, or the 'W' key, will 'work' objects such as
locks, levers, and buttons.  Clicking the left mouse key, or hitting
'G/D' will pick up and drop objects.  If you have picked up an
object, hitting the 'P' key will pitch (throw) it.

If you are on a character's inventory screen, you may still Get and
Drop objects.  Use the right mouse button to 'use' an object.  Use
the left mouse button to exchange an object in the inventory bag for
what's being carried by the mouse.

Icon Menu
---------
The Icon menu is located in the lower right-hand corner of the
screen.  There are 7 icons.

Pressing the ? brings up the help text.

Selecting the wizard, or hitting 'S' will allow you to cast a spell
in one of the four categories -- Water, Earth, Air, or Fire.

Spell Casting
-------------
Hit S or select wizard on the icon menu.  Select spellcaster.  Move
through the spells in the spellbook by clicking the mouse on the
left/right hand edged of the book, or hit W, A, F, or E (for
Water/Air/Fire/Earth).  Spells that the magician knows and for which
he has the strength are presented.  Use the up down arrows to select
or click on the spell with the mouse.  The spell will be cast.  In
the Keep are special gems called T'Ganths.  T'Ganths act as focusing
gems that will boost the power of a magic user if held while
casting.  Locating these will make your magicians much more lethal.

Checking Time of Day
--------------------
Selecting the Timer, or hitting 'T' will display the time of day.

Examining Items
---------------
Selecting the Eyeball , or hitting 'X' will cause your characters to
examine the space in front of them.  Many objects throughout TOME
are trapped.  Before a trap can be disarmed, you must examine the
object to find the trap.  (Another way to find the trap is to use
the object and have the trap explode in your face).

Options
-------
Selecting the Diskette, or hitting ESC will bring up the options
menu.  This menu allows saving/loading/exiting, swapping character
positions, and re-configuring your sound options.

Resting
-------
Selecting the camp fire will rest your characters.  During rest,
stunned characters will awaken, and tired ones will re-gain stamina,
vitality, and magic strength.

Disarming Traps
---------------
Selecting the safe icon, or hitting 'D' will give opportunity to
disarm a trap that has been found by stumbling into it, or through
examination.

Doors
-----
Doors are opened with levers, with buttons, with a key, with a token
and by working combination locks.  When opening a combination lock,
it is easy to jam it.  Using characters skilled at picking locks
will help.  Once a door is jammed, you must either use a
'Knock-Knock' spell, or find a way around the door.  (There is at
least one way around all locked doors in the game.)

Buttons and Levers
------------------
Throughout the game there are many buttons and levers.  These items
might affect something anywhere else in the maze.

Battling Monsters
-----------------
Keep your front characters armed and strong.  If they are weakening,
don't hesitate to use a 'Balm of P'Tah', or even switch their
position with another character.  Use attack spells often.  If
necessary, try backing up right after you have struck (this will
give your characters a chance to recover their hands).  Remember
that certain monsters are immune to certain types of magic.

You have some control over how your characters react in battle.  The
character profile has two entries, Thrust/Swing and Dodge/Guard.
Use the A/D keys or click on them with the mouse.  Thrust means a
quick forward thrust with the weapon.  This results in only a 60%
chance of hitting, but does double damage.  Swing means swinging the
weapon in a broad arc.  This results in a 90% chance of hitting the
enemy and does normal damage.  Dodge means the character ducks.
Guard means the character stands his ground, and tries to hit back.

Monsters
--------
Following is a brief list of some of the creatures of TOME.  Armor
class represents the chance the monster will absorb your blow.  Hit
points represents the amount of vitality of that monster.  Watch out
for monsters with special attacks!  Some monsters will drop items
when they are destroyed.

   Giant spider   AC:4  HP:165-400  Magic Immunity: None
                  Special Attack:Poison

Additional Character Information
--------------------------------
A character also has a food characteristic.  If a character is
starving, his vitality will go down quickly.

The character's current inventory is represented on page two of the
character's attributes.  To select an object, click on it, or move
the selection box and hit Enter (till the object is highlighted in
red).  Once the object is highlighted, you can move it, or, using
the menu, Examine, or Use item.

Page two shows you the amount of weight being carried.
