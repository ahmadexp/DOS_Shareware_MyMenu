The Infernal Tome

one-line description: MVP's The Infernal Tome 3D fantasy
                      role-playing game.

description: The Infernal Tome by MVP Software.  On a world far away
             science has become magic, and a cataclysmic struggle is
             underway between two mystic scientists.  You must
             direct a party of four on a perilous quest to bring
             about peace and reclaim the lost Tome.  But beware!  In
             this 3D fantasy role-playing game of magic, mystery and
             monsters, nothing is as it seems.  Req 386+, VGA; a
             sound card is recommended.
  
Catalog vendors: Please include The Infernal Tome in your printed
                 and disk shareware catalogs.  For best sales
                 results use one of the above descriptions.  In
                 addition, all MVP product listings MUST include the
                 words "by MVP Software" or "an MVP Software
                 production." This encourages repeat sales, which is
                 good for both of us.  The only exception to this is
                 if the catalog has a separate MVP Software section.
                 No vendor may charge a fee of more than $8.00 for
                 the shareware version of this product.  Vendors are
                 encouraged to contact MVP Software directly to get
                 the latest version of the product and to be added
                 to our mailing list for direct mailings of updates
                 and future releases.

Rackware vendors and CD-ROM publishers: Please read our rackware and
                                        CD-ROM distribution policy
                                        below.
