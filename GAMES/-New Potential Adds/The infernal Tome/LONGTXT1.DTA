It has been occupied by           the ShadowKing. It is rumored to sit over         the grave of the dead lord, B'Nah.                Z2      The Draden were an ancient civilization of        magical beings who developed a high level         of culture and technology. It is thought          by some that they were the first race from        which all others have sprung.                     Z3      The ShadowKing is the new reincarnation of        Lord Tenis, once leader of the high council       to which all races give at least some             allegiance. Lord Tenis succombed to the           desire of power and lost his will to B'Nah.       Z4      B'Nah, the Dead Lord, is one of the two           gods who created the world of Garon, and the      people that presently populate the planet,        collectively called the Voranu. B'Nah's           crypt is said to lie below ShardMoure Keep.       Z5      The planet Garon was created by the gods          B'Nah and P'Tah to hide the Infernal Tome, a      book that contains the ultimate power in the      universe. The planet Garon is populated by        Grimhaden, Dryads, Humans, and Halflings.         Z6      The Voranu is the collective name that the        races of Garon refer to themselves as. The        Voranu are ruled from a central authority,        the High Council, and all races pay at            least token loyalty to it.                        Z7      The Dark Path is a way of living that is said     to lead to infinite power for the individual      that follows it. The Dark Path preaches           loyalty to B'Nah, and complete self-              interest in the conduct of one's life.            Z8      The Dark Monks are a collection of beings         from the 4 races that care and tend for           ShardMoure. They are involved in ancient and      dreaded rituals. They are lead by their abbot     Cho-Tek.                                          Z9      Ganryn was the consort of the Lord Tenis.         There's was a love that comes but once in a       century. In the pain and the madness of           B'Nah's embrace, Tenis lashed out and killed      his love-and vowed revenge upon B'Nah             Z17     Firesticks are magical objects capable of         holding a single potent fireball. They can        be recharged at spinning skulls throughout        the castle.
