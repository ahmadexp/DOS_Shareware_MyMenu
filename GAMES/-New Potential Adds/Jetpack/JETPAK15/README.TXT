Thanks to everyone who supported and enjoyed my games,
Jetpack and Squarez Deluxe.  They are now released as freeware,
since they are old and there's no way to order them any more.

In the main folder is the final freeware version of Jetpack.
Also included is the Jetpack Graphics Module Switcher, with
Christmas Jetpack and Jetpack Junior modules.

"SQUAREZ" is the final freeware version of Squarez Deluxe.
