PROBLEM:
     Not Enough Memory
SOLUTION:
     Try removing TSR's (such as mouse drivers) from your config.sys and
     autoexec.bat files.
     If you have DOS version 5 or above, include the line:

          dos=high

     in your config.sys file after "himem.sys" or another memory manager has
     been loaded.


PROBLEM:
     Movement is erratic, or there is no movement
SOLUTION:
     Press [J] to adjust your joystick(s).
     Most systems should work with automatic joystick detection.  If movement
     is still erratic, try disabling joysticks in the command-line with
     "Squarez /J".
     You can also disable the mouse ("Squarez /M").


PROBLEM:
     Sound isn't working correctly, or the game locks up
SOLUTION:
     Use the command-line sound card override.
     Load Squarez with one of the command-line options:

          Squarez /S0    -    No Sound
          Squarez /S1    -    PC Speaker
          Squarez /S2    -    Adlib or Sound Blaster compatible

SOUND BLASTER HELP
------------------
If your Sound Blaster or compatible card is not working in Squarez, try
running the included utility "SETBLAST".  This will verify that your
Sound Blaster or compatible is set correctly.

If the game continually locks up and you have a Sound Blaster, as a last
resort try disabling sound card usage by using the command line override
(Squarez /S1).

Squarez should have come without the configuration file "SQUAREZ.CFG"  If you
can't solve the problems you are having, try erasing this file.  Squarez will
create a new config file based on your system.
