* Note for DOSBox users *

This software is fully installed and configured to run in the DOSBox emulator.
You can simply drag and drop the file WRATH.BAT over the DOSBox icon to start
playing. Experienced DOSBox users may choose other methods of startup.

The software was configured and tested to work with the official DOSBox build
v0.74-3 available from www.dosbox.com. It may or may not work with any other
third-party DOSBox distributions that are available.

For playing instructions and other information, please refer to the electronic
manual (MANUAL.EXE) found in the WRATH directory.


!!! IMPORTANT !!!

Wrath of Earth will only work in DOSBox if EMS memory is turned off.

This distribution of the shareware version will automatically disable EMS and
turn it back on upon exit from the game, but only if you run it via the
provided WRATH.BAT file.

You can also manually disable EMS emulation in DOSBox:

Open your DOSBox configuration file (by default it is dosbox-0.74-3.conf) in a
text editor of your choice and find the following line:

ems=true

Change this to:

ems=false

Save and close dosbox-0.74-3.conf.
