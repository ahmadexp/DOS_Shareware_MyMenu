FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

What do I do when I am low on health or ammo?
    Look for hidden storage areas.  The secret passages can be
    located by looking carfully at variations in wall texture.
    Look for a change in color, someting added like moss, or 
    something removed like zendel.

What happens if I die? 
    You start over again at the begining of that level with just
    the pluser.
    
I can't make it very far without dying?
    Use god mode ([CRTL] [ALT] [I]) the first couple of times you go
    through a new area, also look for secret storage areas as they
    often contain ammo and health.

I don't have enough memory?

    system with at least 4Mb of ram.  There needs to be at least 
    2.8Mb free of extended or expanded memory for this game to run.

I have a 386 and it is slow.
    We make cuting edge games and they run best on the latest
