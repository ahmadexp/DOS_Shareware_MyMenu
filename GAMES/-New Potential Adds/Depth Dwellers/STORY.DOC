                    THE BACKGROUND STORY

	You remember your first visit to Ora as the son of Earth's
ambassador to the Depth Dwellers.  The first thing you noticed
was the blueness of the world.  The blue of the mineral Zendle
seemed to jump off Ora and into your ship. It also reflected the
mood of the inhabitancy.  After centuries of war with the
neighboring planet, Riase, the Depth Dwellers had been forced to
live within the tunnels they created beneath the planet's
surface.  Even their bodies adapted.  Their eyes now enlarged,
seem to reflect the sadness of a life spent buried beneath the
surface.

Your father had been sent by Earth to see if he could bring
diplomatic peace between the Ri and the Depth Dwellers.  The
Council of the Depth Dwellers had requested your father because
of his abilities to handle the most despicable foes and make
them able to see the advantages of peace.

The Ri were unmoveable.  They wanted Ora at any price.  Even if
it meant killing every last Depth Dweller.  Riase had long ago
been fouled by the Ri's consumption of resources without regards
to the long term effects it would have on the environment.  Now
Riase lay bare.  All of it's lush gardens and fertile valleys
gone.  The only thing that moves on the surface is the dust
picked up by the wind as it blows over the parched land.

The only good to come out of your stay on Ora was your
relationship with Princess Aurora.  As children you played
together at all the social functions.   Later she would debate
the need for the Depth Dwellers to fight the Ri.  Military
training was the answer.  Together you would spend your days
mastering various weapons and learning other combat skills.  

The last night you were together Princess Aurora told you that
she and some others had decided that the time had come for
action.  The Ri had discovered that Zendle could be used in the
manufacturing of a new weapons system.  The Ri wanted Ora's
Zendle and they were using the Depth Dwellers to mine it. 
Princess Aurora said they had intercepted messages that were sent
between the Ri's mining operation and Riasa.  The Ri were no
longer  content to just conquer Ora, they wanted all nine
planets in their solar system.  Her moist eyes reflected all the
pain, misery and destruction that awaited the other planets if the
Ri's plan succeed.  You took her in your arms hoping for a
moment they might shield her from the pain.
