NOTE:  Some black-and-white computer monitors will not be able to
       display the SLEUTH houses.  This situation only holds for
       non-IBM displays.  If you are unable to see the outline of
       some of the SLEUTH houses, you can turn off all color in
       the picture by running the batch file BW.  To start this
       batch file, simply type 'BW' at the system prompt.
       WARNING!!  This procedure permanently erases files for
       use with color monitors.  Do not use this procedure with
       your original distribution diskette!
