As you begin a game of SLEUTH a murder has just been committed.
Your job is  to mingle  with the houseguests and  to search the
contents of the house until you feel you have solved the crime.
Every game of SLEUTH is different so you must fully explore the
house each time that you play. As your investigation proceeds 
the murderer  will begin to grow suspicious and  will most likely  
start plotting your demise. If you have not figured out who the  
murderer is by this  point in the game, your chances of survival 
are slim.
