FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

     Here are some of the questions that were asked frequently over the past
     few years:

     ----

     Q:  How can I beat the big fish at the end of the first world?

     A:  You have to land on top of its head (right above the eyes) five
         times. Run CHARLIE -H for a demo (new in version 1.9) or run the
         HELPME.BAT program.

     ----

     Q:  Have you made any more games?

     A:  Yes, they can be found on the Internet (see the URLs below). Select
         CATALOG in the main menu to see some screen shots.

     ----

     Q:  Have you made any new games yet? When will the next one be ready?

     A:  I don't know. I'm usually working on several games at the same
         time and I don't release a game before its completely finished.

     ----

     Q:  I've registered the game, but everything is still exactly the same
         as in the unregistered version! What's going on?

     A:  So far, everyone who has asked this had both versions on disk and
         was still running the unregistered version. If you install the game
         again in a different location, you should update any shortcuts in
         Windows that point to the game.

         The registered version does begin with the first world, just like
         the demo version, but it also contains a second and a third world.

         If you use the HELPME.BAT program to register and to start the game
         as well, everything should work properly.

     ----

     Q:  How do you make this kind of games?

     A:  I programmed CHARLIE THE DUCK with Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0 (using
         lots of inline assembly), all drawings were made with my own sprite
         editor GRED. You can find some information about creating games on
         the Wiering Software web site, including links to some resources.

     ----

     Q:  I just can't get through level ..., I'm frustrated. Can you give a
         step-by-step description and also tell where all the hidden items
         are?

     A:  No, I don't think it would be much fun anymore if you knew all the
         secrets. Just keep practicing, all of the levels are playable!

     ----

     Q:  How can I make an icon for this game on my Windows desktop?

     A:  Run the HELPME.BAT program.

     ----

     Q:  The game is really slow. Is there a way to make it any faster?

     A:  The settings for the background layer can make a great difference on
         some (older) computers. From the main menu choose OPTIONS and then
         BACKGROUND. The default is PARALLAX, which can be slow. Change it to
         STATIC or NONE.

     ----

     Q:  If I have saved my progress in Level 3-3 for example, is it still
         possible to start at the beginning of that world?

     A:  Yes, press [Shift]+[Enter] instead of [Enter] when selecting a game
         and you will start at the beginning of that world.
