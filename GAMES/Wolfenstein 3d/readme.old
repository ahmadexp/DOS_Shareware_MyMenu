----------------------------------------
Wolfenstein 3D is an episodic
first-person shooter and a follow-up
to the top-down infiltration game 
Castle Wolfenstein. The game puts the 
player in the boots of B.J. Blazkowicz,
an allied spy. There are six episodes:
the first distributed complete as 
shareware; the second and the third
available after registration; and the 
three final missions (which happen
before the events of the first episode) 
available in the Nocturnal Missions pack.

In the first episode (Escape from Wolfenstein), B.J. is captured, but
 overpowers a guard with the help of a concealed knife and manages to get
 out of his cell. Throughout the next nine levels the player guides B.J. 
 searching for an escape from Wolfenstein, guarded by Hans Grosse. After
 returning to Allied territory, B.J. is given the instructions to
 Operation: Eisenfaust, where he has to stop Dr. Schabbs and his army of
 mutant prototypes before they are released into the battlefields. The
 final mission (Die, FÃ¼hrer, Die!) has a simple goal: infiltrate the
 bunker under the Reichstag, and terminate Hitler (in a robotic suit)
 himself.
