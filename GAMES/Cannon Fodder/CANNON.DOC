                                Cannon Fodder

                       An MVP Software Shareware release

                                 of a game by

                       Virgin Interactive Entertainment


Before beginning Cannon Fodder for the first time, please run the SETUP.EXE
program.  This will setup your sound card properly.

If you encounter problems running Cannon Fodder there may be insufficient low
memory available.  Cannon Fodder requires 580K free RAM.  Here's a possible
way to solve the problem. Place a blank diskette into drive A of your computer.
Then type:

   FORMAT A: /S /U

and press enter.  When the computer is finished, type:

   EDIT A:\CONFIG.SYS

and press ENTER.  Then type the following lines:

   DEVICE=C:\DOS\HIMEM.SYS
   DOS=HIGH

Then press the following keys: ALT, F, X, Y. Reboot your computer leaving the
disk in the A: drive.  Load your mouse driver.  Go to the Cannon Fodder
directory and type INSTALL to install the game.  After installation, type
CANNON to play the game.  Whenever you want to play Cannon Fodder, simply
reboot your computer with the boot disk you've created.

NOTE: You may encounter problems with the Diamond Stealth Pro VLB video card.
We are sorry for the inconvenience.

CANNON FODDER, WINDOWS, AND MOUSE DRIVERS
-----------------------------------------
Although you may be able to run Cannon Fodder under Windows by opening a DOS
window, the software is designed to run under DOS.  We recommend that you
exit Windows completely before running the software.  If you do run Cannon
Fodder from Windows, please note that the DOS mouse driver must be loaded.

DOS requires that a mouse driver is loaded before any program can recognize
the mouse.  Windows has a built-in mouse driver, but this will not work in
DOS.  Before you attempt to run Cannon Fodder make sure the MOUSE.COM or
MOUSE.SYS file is loaded.  These files are provided on a disk that came with
your mouse.  Check your DOS manual if you don't how to load either file.

INSTALLATION
------------
First, make sure you have the following files:

CANEXIT.COM
CANNON.COM
CANNON.DOC      (This file)
CFODDER.EXE
CF_ENG.DAT
FILE_ID.DIZ
SETUP.EXE
LICENSE.DOC
ORDER.FRM
READ.ME
SETUP.DAT
SYSOP.DOC
VENDOR.DOC

Before beginning Cannon Fodder for the first time, type INSTALL from your
Cannon Fodder directory at the DOS prompt.  You MUST have a mouse on your
system and a mouse driver loaded in memory.  Choose CONFIGURE from the menu
to change settings for sound, and other options.  Save the settings
and exit the install program.

Type CANNON to run Cannon Fodder.

GAME PLAY
---------
All the action takes place in the play field which takes up most of the
screen.  On the screen you will see the Status Panel in the upper left
and the Map icon in the lower left.

You begin at Boot Hill with recruits lining up to join your efforts.  This is
also where you can load or save a mission, and see how to register Cannon
Fodder (By pressing F1).  Click anywhere on Boot Hill to start your mission.

Once in your mission, use the mouse to guide your pointer around the screen.
Press the left mouse button to move your troop to the end of the pointer.
Move the mouse to guide the pointer to an enemy and press the right mouse
button to change the pointer into a cross-hair cursor and shoot your guns.
Your bullets are "smart" and will not harm allies; however, grenades and
bazookas will.

In later missions, you might find grenades and/or bazookas.  To fire these,
move the pointer to the upper left of the screen (over the status panel).  If
you have any grenades or bazookas, there will be a quantity below their
respective icon.  Click on that icon to highlight it.  Now move the pointer
to where you want to fire your weapon.  Press and hold the right mouse button.
Press the left mouse button, then let go of both buttons.  Be careful where
you aim!  

There are times when the strategy dictates that the troopers split up.  So
long as you have enough troopers, you can make a maximum of two new troops.

   - Select the name(s) of the troopers you'd like to form a new troop 
     (the names will highlight when you click on them).

   - Select the troopers logo (above the grenade & bazooka stats) to 
     form a new troop with the troopers you highlighted.

But Wait!  Who gets the weapons when you split up?  When you begin to split a
troop, grenades and bazookas are outlined.  By clicking on these icons, you
determine who gets what.

   - The solid outline represents all quantities of that weapon.
   - The dotted outline represents half the quantities of that weapon.
   - No outline represents none of that weapon.

To regroup troops, simply walk them into each other.  They will automatically
regroup.

The following keys are active during gameplay:

   P      - Pauses and unpauses the game.
   M      - Views the map during a phase.
   F1     - Shows ordering information (From Boot Hill).
   ESC    - Surrenders and restarts current phase (only press this if 
            you're giving up and want to start this phase over).
            Pressing ESC again will take you to Boot Hill.
   ALT-Q  - EXITS the game!  Only press this if you want to exit to DOS.
