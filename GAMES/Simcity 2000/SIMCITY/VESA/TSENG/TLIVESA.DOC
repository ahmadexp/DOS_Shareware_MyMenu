                VESA Super VGA BIOS Extension Driver


TLIVESA.COM is the VESA Super VGA BIOS Extension driver for video
boards based on Tseng Labs ET3000 and ET4000 chips. The driver
implements Version 1.1 of the VESA specification and is a
terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) program which intercepts the video
BIOS interrupt vector to provide additional BIOS commands supporting
super-VGA modes.

To load, type the command:

        TLIVESA [ENTER]

at the DOS prompt. TLIVESA may be loaded through a batch file for
convenience. After loading the driver, any VESA application can be
run.

The program can also be unloaded, freeing up memory, provided no other
resident program which intercepts the video BIOS interrupt vector is
loaded afterward. (Actually, no resident program at all should be
loaded afterward in order to really free the memory.)

To unload, type the command:

        TLIVESA U [ENTER]

Unloading TLIVESA may also be performed through a batch file.
