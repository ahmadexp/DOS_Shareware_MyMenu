Oak Technologies has several different VESA drivers each for a 
specific video card.  If you are unsure which video card you have,
contact the manufacturer.

67VESA.COM   is for boards that use the Oak Technology OTI-67 chip.
37VESA.COM   is for boards that use the Oak Technology OTI-37 chip.

To use one of the two above programs, simply type in the name of the
program at the DOS prompt.
