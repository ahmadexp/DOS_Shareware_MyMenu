   Please note that this game has been hex-edited to remove the Konami and
    Gametek logos, as the game is no longer licenced to these publishers.

      It is not an updated version of the game and as such may have issues
            with some modern PCs. Refer to readme.txt for help if you
                    have problems getting the game running.
