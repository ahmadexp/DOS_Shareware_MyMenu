     INTRODUCTION
     __________________________________________________________________


         High resolution VGA's and full color scanners have led to the
         availability of a mass volume of high quality digitized
         images. Most of the images found on Bulletin Board Systems
         (BBS's) are stored in the Graphics Interchange Format (GIF).

         Do you spend a lot of time in transferring those GIF images?
         Would you like to preview the images while you are downloading
         them? Or maybe abort the transfer (or skip the images) as soon
         as you realize you do not like the GIF images? (Think about
         all the download credit you can save!)


     WHAT IS GIFLINK

         GIFLink is an easy to use external protocol driver that allows
         you to view the transmitting GIF images in stunning SuperVGA
         graphics. And it is the first protocol driver that uses full
         screen computer graphics in SuperVGA mode.

         GIFLink supports most of the popular file transfer protocols
         such as Zmodem, Batch Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem and CompuServe
         QuickB. If the files being transmitted are not GIF images,
         GIFLink will work just like a normal protocol drivers. This
         allows GIFLink to transmitted any files, not just GIF images.

         GIFLink also has a special VIEW mode so that you can look at
         the received GIF images in a slideshow format or preview the
         images you are going to sent.

         Using GIFLink is much like using the other protocol drivers.
         If you have used any external protocol driver, you will find
         yourself already familiar with the command structure and
         options. And it is easy to install as an external protocol for
         most communication softwares.

         If you have any questions, you can write to us, or leave e-
         mail to "Winfred Hu" in the following BBSs' TELEMATE
         conference or in CompuServe to [72070,3515]. We appreciate
         suggestions and ideas.

     USING GIFLINK
     __________________________________________________________________


         GIFLink requires an IBM PC/AT/fully compatible computer, DOS
         3.0 or higher, VGA or SuperVGA display card, a modem and a
         minimum of 240K bytes of memory.

         GIFLink supports most major SuperVGA adapters, including
         Ahead, ATI, Chips & Tech, Everex, Genoa, Paradise, Oak,
         Trident (both 8800 and 8900, 9000), Tseng (both 3000 and 4000
         chipsets), Video7 and video cards with VESA capability.

         Note: If your communication program have the ability to swap
         itself out when running an external program, you should enable
         the feature so that GIFLink can have enough memory to run.


     COMMAND LINE

         All the commands used can be entered on the command line at
         the DOS prompt. These options tell GIFLink to carry out
         certain commands when the program is loaded.

         The GIFLink command line structure is:

            GIFLINK [Options] Command [Files] [@ListFile]

         Parameters lists in [] are optional. If no option and command
         is specified, GIFLink will display a help screen listing the
         basic options, commands and examples.

         [Options] are the GIFLink options that you can specify. The
         following is a summary of all options available.

             -b      Define the baud rate you want to use
             -c      Define the connection you want to use
             -d      Delete received files
             -e      Define the effective baud rate
             -f      Specify a file transfer directory
             -fifo   Disable 16550 FIFO buffer
             -hs     Enable slow handshake
             -k      Do not keep partially received files
             -l      Specify a DSZ-type log file
             -m      Use monochrome 64 grey scale display mode
             -p      Define the COM port you are using
             -r      Enable Zmodem crash recovery
             -rg     Enable Zmodem crash recovery and GIF recovery
             -tm     Enable direct Telemate support
             -v      Specify the display mode
             -w      Wait a number of seconds between files

         <Command> tells GIFLink to receive or send files using one of
         the many file transfer protocols, or view GIF images. It is
         not optional and must be present in the GIFLink command line.
         The following is a summary of the commands:

         [Files] is one of more file names to be transferred. It can
         contains wildcard character '*' and '?' in a batch protocol.

         [@ListFile] is a file containing a list of the files to be
         sent. It can only be used when you are sending or viewing the
         files. You should used this list file when the files cannot be
         expressed as a wildcard easily. The names in the list file are
         separated by a space or a carriage return and the names can
         contain wildcard characters.


     RUNNING GIFLINK

         Starting GIFLink is easy, just type

             GIFLINK -p2 rz

         in the DOS command line. It tells GIFLink to use COM2 at the
         current speed and receive files using Zmodem. More advanced
         options will be described in the next section, the CALLING
         GIFLINK FROM COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS and the EXAMPLES section.

         When GIFLink is running, it shows the transmitting GIF images
         in the optimal size so that the full image always fits in the
         screen. And it also displays a number of useful information
         such as COM port, baud rate, file name, estimated transfer
         time, image resolutions and so on.

         Now let's look at what you can do inside GIFLink.


     [Esc]   Abort transfer

         To abort the transfer, press the [Esc] key. GIFLink will abort
         the transfer and exit. If you are calling GIFLink from a
         communication program, it will return to the communication
         program. You may need to press [Ctrl X] several times to abort
         the transfer.


     GIFLINK                                         USING GIFLINK    6


     [K]     Keep partial

         Pressing the [K] key will toggle the 'Keep partial' option. It
         is equivalent to the -k command line option. When this option
         is on, GIFLink will keep the aborted or skipped files.
         Otherwise, the partially received files will be deleted.


     [D]     Delete received

         Pressing the [D] key will toggle the 'Delete received' option.
         It is equivalent to the -d command line option. When this
         option is on, the current file will be deleted after it is
         received! It is very useful when you have limited disk space
         or do not wish to keep the GIF images being transmitted.

         This option does not delete all the received files. It only
         deletes the current file after it is received. On the other
         word, you can choose which files you want to keep and which
         ones you want to delete during the transmission.


     [R]     Resume aborted

         Pressing the [R] key will toggle the 'Resume aborted' option
         (Zmodem crash recovery and GIF recovery). This option is
         equivalent to the -rg command line option and it is available
         for Zmodem receive command only.


     [S]     Skip file

         Zmodem has a special mechanism to skip a file without aborting
         a batch transfer. Pressing the [S] key will skip the current
         file and start to receive the next file. This option is
         available for Zmodem receive command only.


     GIFLINK                                       COMMAND OPTIONS    7


     COMMAND OPTIONS
     __________________________________________________________________


         All command options must be preceded by a '-' or '/'
         character. Of the many options, the -p<Port> option is the
         most important one and should be included in the command line.
         All the options are described below.


     -b<Baud>   Define the baud rate you want to use.

         This option allows you to define the baud rate you want to
         use. The valid <Baud> values are

             300, 1200, 2400, 4800, 9600, 19200, 38400, 57600, 115200

         For example, -b2400 tells GIFLink to use 2400 baud.

         If you are using a high speed modem which has a 14400 bps or
         higher throughput, you should use the 19200 or 38400 baud rate
         in GIFLink and lock the modem at that transfer rate. Please
         refer to the modem manual for locking the transfer rate.

         Normally, there is no need to specify this option because
         GIFLink will detect which baud rate the COM port is currently
         using.


     -c<Connection>      Define the connection you want to use.

         GIFLink can use a number of methods to talk to the remote
         system (connections), namely Modem, Computer, FOSSIL and BIOS.
         The valid <Connection> values are

             M      Direct modem connection
             C      Direct computer-to-computer connection
             F      Connect through FOSSIL driver
             B      Connect through BIOS 14H

         For example, -cF specifies a FOSSIL connection.

         The default method is Modem connection and GIFLink will use
         its own high performance COM interrupt routines to send and
         receive data. RTS/CTS flow control is used if the CTS signal
         is active initially.

         You should use the Computer connection if you are using a null
         modem or a direct computer-to-computer cable. With this
         connection, GIFLink will skip detecting the carrier signal
         which may not present in the null modem or cable. Like the
         Modem connection, the Computer connection uses the RTS/CTS
         flow control if the CTS signal is active initially.


     GIFLINK                                       COMMAND OPTIONS    8


         A FOSSIL driver is a COM interrupt driver which is commonly
         used by Bulletin Board System softwares. There is no need to
         use the driver unless you encounter some compatibility problem
         with the GIFLink's internal COM interrupt routines or you need
         a special service in a FOSSIL driver (e.g. IRQ sharing).

         A BIOS connection is only useful if you use a computer network
         and your network driver overrides the BIOS 14H interrupt and
         provides high performance data transmission. Otherwise, you
         should not use this option because you will encounter data
         lost at 2400 baud or above.


     -d      Delete received files.

         This special option allows you to delete the files after it is
         received! It is very useful when you have limited disk space
         or do not wish to keep the GIF images being transmitted.

         You can also press the [D] key to toggle this option when
         GIFLink is running. The GIF image is not deleted until it is
         received.


     -e<Baud>   Define the effective baud rate.

         Some modems allows you to lock the COM port at a higher baud
         rate then the actual baud rate in order to yield the maximum
         throughput. However, this influences the estimation of the
         maximum cps (character per second) rate. This option corrects
         the estimation.

         For example, -e14400 tells GIFLink to estimate the maximum cps
         rate at 14400 baud.


     -f<Directory>      Specify a file transfer directory.

         Depends on the transfer command, this option specifies either
         the upload (for send command) or download (for receive
         command) directory. For example, -fD:\TRANSFER specifies
         D:\TRANSFER as the file transfer directory.

         All files are assumed in the file transfer directory unless a
         pathname is specified. If both the file transfer directory and
         a pathname are not given, the current directory will be used.

         The DIRRX environment variable also indicate where GIFLink
         should put the received files. For example,

             SET DIRRX=D:\DOWNLOAD

         have the same effect as the -fD:\DOWNLAOD option for a receive
         command. The -f option always overrides the environment
         variable.


     GIFLINK                                       COMMAND OPTIONS    9


     -fifo      Disable 16550 FIFO buffer.

         By default, GIFLink will use the FIFO buffer when a 16550 UART
         chip is found. The FIFO buffer will provide extra protection
         against data lost. If this option is specified, the FIFO
         buffer will be disabled.

         This option has no effect on a FOSSIL or BIOS connection. The
         FOSSIL driver or the network driver should have its own option
         to control the FIFO buffer.


     -hs     Enable slow handshake.

         Some computers encounter COM data lost during disk I/O. In
         this case, you should specify this option so that GIFLink will
         lower the RTS signal (which suspend COM activity) during disk
         I/O.

         If you are using a disk cache program, you should also disable
         the caching mechanism before running GIFLink.


     -k      Do not keep partially received files.

         By default, GIFLink keeps partially received files. This
         option allows you to delete an aborted files.

         You can press the [K] key to toggle this option when GIFLink
         is running.


     -l<DSZ.LOG>      Specify a DSZ-type log file.

         GIFLink can generate a DSZ-type log file if you specify this
         options. For example, -l\COMM\DSZ.LOG will put the usage log
         into the \COMM\DSZ.LOG file.

         The DSZLOG environment variable can indicate where GIFLink
         should put the usage log. For example,

             SET DSZLOG=\COMM\DSZ.LOG

         have the same effect as the -l\COMM\DSZ.LOG option. The -l
         option always overrides the environment variable.

         If both the DSZLOG environment variable and the -l option are
         NOT present, GIFLink will not generate a DSZ-type log file.


     -m      Use monochrome 64 grey-scale display mode.

         Normally, GIFLink displays the GIF images in SuperVGA 256
         color display mode. If you have a black and white monitor, you
         may want to specify this option.


     GIFLINK                                      COMMAND OPTIONS    10


     -p<Port>      Define the COM port you are using.

         This is the most important option for GIFLink. It tells
         GIFLink which COM port it should use. The range for <Port> is
         1 to 8. For example, if you are using COM2, you should use -p2
         in the GIFLink command line.

         The DSZPORT environment variable can indicate which COM port
         GIFLink should use. For example,

             SET DSZPORT=2

         have the same effect as the -p2 option. The -p option always
         overrides the environment variable. If you are using only one
         modem, you should use the DSZPORT environment variable so that
         you do not need to specify the -p<Port> option every time.

         By default, GIFLink use COM1 if both the -p<Port> option and
         the DSZPORT environment variable are not specified.


     -p<Base,IRQ>  Define the COM base address and IRQ you are using.

         GIFLink uses the following base address and IRQ number:

             Port     Base address     IRQ
             ----     ------------     ---
             COM1       3F8 (Hex)       4
             COM2       2F8             3
             COM3       3E8             4
             COM4       2E8             3
             COM5      3220             4
             COM6      3228             3
             COM7      4220             4
             COM8      4228             3

         If you have a different setting, you can use the -p<Base,IRQ>
         option to specify the base address and IRQ number. For
         example, -p3E8,5 tells GIFLink to use 3E8 as the COM base
         address and IRQ5. GIFLink will indicate COM5 is being used
         because it always redefines COM5 to the new base address and
         IRQ, although the actual COM port may not be COM5.

         You should NOT use the -p<Port> option when you are using the
         -p<Base,IRQ> option.

         The DSZPORT environment variable can indicate which COM base
         address and IRQ number GIFLink should use For example,

             SET DSZPORT=3E8,5

         have the same effect as the -p3E8,5 option. The -p<Base,IRQ>
         option always overrides the environment variable.



     GIFLINK                                      COMMAND OPTIONS    11


     -r      Enable Zmodem crash recovery.

         This option enables Zmodem crash recovery which allows you to
         resume an aborted transfer. It is available for the Zmodem
         receive command only. Before resuming an aborted transfer,
         GIFLink performs a date check to ensure that it is the same
         file. If the date check fail, GIFLink renames the new file
         instead of resuming the transfer.


     -rg     Enable Zmodem crash recovery and GIF recovery.

         In addition to the Zmodem crash recovery, GIFLink have a
         special option called GIF recovery. When a GIF file is being
         resumed, GIFLink will display the interrupted GIF image before
         starting the recovery process. It is available for the Zmodem
         receive command only.

         Without this option, the recovering GIF image will not be
         displayed.


     -tm<TM.CFG>     Enable direct Telemate support.

         GIFLink supports Telemate (the best communication program)
         directly. It will read a Telemate configuration file and
         enable or disable certain options.

         If the configuration file is not found, this option is discard
         and do not generate any error. If it is found, GIFLink will
         write the log into the Telemate usage log file TM.USE directly
         using the proper format. If you want to generate a DSZ-type
         log file instead, you must specify the -l<DSZ.LOG> option to
         override the -tm option.

         For example, -tmC:\TELEMATE\TM.CFG tells GIFLink where to find
         the Telemate configuration file.

         If you have defined the TMCFG environment variable, you can
         simply specify the -tm option without the filename. For
         example, -tm will read the Telemate configuration file
         indicated by the TMCFG environment variable. If the
         environment variable is not defined, GIFLink will attempt to
         read TM.CFG from the current directory. The following option
         in the Telemate configuration file have effect on GIFLink:

             COM port
             COM base, IRQ
             Connection
             Zmodem crash recovery
             16550 FIFO
             RTS/CTS flow control
             Upload directory
             Download directory
             Log directory
             Usage log

     GIFLINK                                      COMMAND OPTIONS    12


         You should specify the -tm option as the first option and then
         use the other options to override the setting in the Telemate
         configuration file.


     -v<Width,Height,Color>      Specify the display mode.

         GIFLink supports a broad range of SuperVGA adapters and
         display modes. The following display modes are supported:

              1024,768,256
               800,600,256
               640,480,256
               640,400,256
              1024,768,16  (grey-scale)
               800,600,16  (grey-scale)
               640,480,16  (grey-scale)

         All 16 color modes displays the GIF images in 16 grey-scale
         level. 256 color modes displays the GIF images in full colors.
         (UNREGISTERED version only displays the first 2 GIF images in
         full colors. The rest are displayed in 64 grey-scale level.)

         For example, -v1024,768,16 tells GIFLink to switch to 1024x768
         in 16 grey-scale display mode. If the display mode you
         specified is not supported by your display adapter, GIFLink
         will switch to a lower resolution automatically.

         You can also use abbreviate resolution. For example, -v800
         specifies 800x600 256 color display mode and -v640,400
         specifies the 640x400 256 color display mode.

         If GIFLink cannot find the display mode your display adapter
         actually support, you should look for a VESA driver in the
         driver diskette that come with your adapter. If you do not
         have one, please contact your dealer for the VESA driver. Most
         major SuperVGA producers have their own drivers to ensure
         compatibility with other programs.


     -w<Second>      Wait a number of seconds after each file.

         You can define a delay after each file transfer. The delay
         allows you to look at the GIF image before the next transfer.
         The delay should not be more than 10 seconds. Otherwise, the
         remote system may abort the file transfer. For example, -w5
         specifies a 5 seconds delay. The default delay is 1 second.



     GIFLINK                                ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES    13


     ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     __________________________________________________________________


         GIFLink supports a number of common environment variables used
         by other external protocol drivers. It makes the GIFLink
         command line a lot shorter, and easier to set up if you are
         using other external protocol drivers.

         You should put the statements in the AUTOEXEC.BAT so that they
         are defined automatically every time you turn on your
         computer. In case if DOS reports that it is running out of
         environment space, you can put the following line in the
         CONFIG.SYS.

             SHELL=\COMMAND.COM /p /e:1200

         The /e:1200 enlarges the environment space to 1200 bytes. Use
         a larger number of you run out of space again.

         The environment variables are read in the following order and
         the later options will override an earlier ones.

             DSZPORT
             DSZLOG
             DIRRX
             GIFLINK
            (GIFLink command line options)


     SET GIFLINK=<Options>

         You can put the most frequently used options in the GIFLINK
         environment variable. For example,

              SET GIFLINK=-tm -v800 -rg

         enables direct Telemate support, specifies 800x600 256 color
         display mode and enables Zmodem crash recovery and GIF
         recovery.

         You should not put the receive command or send command (e.g.
         rz/rb/sz/sb) in the variable. Otherwise, you will not be able
         to override it in the GIFLink command line.


     SET TMCFG=<TM.CFG>

         This environment variable helps GIFLink and Telemate to locate
         the Telemate configuration file. If you use the -tm option in
         GIFLink which enables direct Telemate support, GIFLink will
         find the Telemate configuration file automatically if you have
         this environment variable defined. For example

             SET GIFLINK=-tm
             SET TMCFG=C:\TELEMATE\TM.CFG

     GIFLINK                                ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES    14


         tells GIFLink to use C:\TELEMATE\TM.CFG as the Telemate
         configuration file.

         Note: This environment variable is not read until you specify
         the -tm option.


     SET DSZPORT=<Port>

         This environment variables defines the COM port you want to
         use. For example,

             SET DSZPORT=2

         tells GIFLink to use COM2. You can use the -p<Port> option in
         the GIFLink command line to override this variable.

         If you are using only one modem, you should use the DSZPORT
         environment variable so that you do not need to specify the -p
         option every time.


     SET DSZPORT=<Base,IRQ>

         This environment variables defines the COM base address and
         IRQ you want to use. For example,

             SET DSZPORT=3E8,5

         tells GIFLink to use 3E8 as the COM base address and IRQ5. You
         can use the -p<Base,IRQ> option in the GIFLink command line to
         override this variable.

         Again, if you are using only one modem, you should use this
         environment variable so that you do not need to specify the -p
         option every time.


     SET DSZLOG=<DSZ.LOG>

         This environment variable defines the location of the DSZ-type
         log file. For example,

             SET DSZLOG=C:\COMM\DSZ.LOG

         tells GIFLink to put the DSZ-type log in C:\COMM\DSZ.LOG. You
         can use the -l<DSZ.LOG> or -tm<TM.CFG> option to override this
         variable.



     GIFLINK                                ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES    15


     SET DIRRX=<Download Directory>

         This environment variable specifies the download directory.
         For example,

             SET DIRRX=D:\DOWNLOAD

         tells GIFLink to put the received file into the D:\DOWNLOAD
         directory. You can use the -f<Directory> option to override
         this variable.

     CALLING GIFLINK FROM COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS
     __________________________________________________________________


         GIFLink can be installed easily as an external protocol in
         most modern communication programs. Normally, a batch file is
         called to run an external protocol. And we will use the batch
         files GIFZ-U.BAT and GIFZ-D.BAT in the following example.

         The GIFZ-U.BAT contains the Zmodem send command:

             GIFLINK -p%2 sz %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

         where %2 is the COM port currently used by Telemate. %3 and
         the rest are the files to be sent. Other communication
         programs may pass the COM port and file name in different
         orders. Please refer to the document of your communication
         program for details on parameter passing.

         Similarly, the GIFZ-D.BAT contains the Zmodem receive command:

             GIFLINK -p%2 rz

         GIFLink supports a rich number of file transfer protocols and
         Zmodem is generally recommended because of its reliability and
         flexibility. That is why we put the Zmodem send and receive
         commands in the batch files respectively. You can put other
         protocol commands (e.g. sb/rb) into your own batch files.

         IMPORTANT: If your communication program have the ability to
         swap itself out when running an external program, you should
         enable the feature so that GIFLink can have enough memory to
         run.

         If GIFLink cannot find the display mode your display adapter
         actually support, you should look for a VESA driver in the
         driver diskette that come with your adapter. If you do not
         have one, please contact your dealer for the VESA driver. Most
         major SuperVGA producers have their own drivers to ensure
         compatibility with other programs.


     Installing GIFLink in Telemate

         If you are using Telemate 4.00 or higher, the default Telemate
         configuration has already set up GIFLink as an external
         protocol. All you have to do is to customize your GIFLink
         setting in the GIFZ-U.BAT and GIFZ-D.BAT batch files or the
         GIFLINK environment variable.

         Note: You should enable the 'Maximize DOS Shell' option under
         the Options/General dialog so that GIFLink can have enough
         memory to run.

         If your Telemate configuration does not have GIFLink, please
         following the steps below:

     GIFLINK           CALLING GIFLINK FROM COMMUNICATION PROGRAMS   17


         First, copy GIFLINK.EXE, GIFZ-D.BAT and GIFZ-U.BAT into your
         Telemate directory, or into a directory included in your PATH
         environment variable.

         Then run Telemate and go to the Options/External protocol
         dialog. You can install GIFLink in one of the empty slot.
         Press [Tab] to go to the field and fill in the content as
         follows:

              Field                     Content
              -----                     -------
              Protocol Name             GIFLink
              Key                       F
              Upload Batch              GIFZ-U
              Download Batch            GIFZ-D
              Prompt Download name      (blank)
              Auto Download Sequence    (blank)

         Then press [Enter] to end the dialog and select the Save
         Options in the Options menu to save the changes.

         Now you have installed GIFLink as an external protocol in
         Telemate.


     Customizing your GIFLink

         Although you can edit the GIFZ-U.BAT and GIFZ-D.BAT to
         customize your GIFLink, you can use the GIFLINK environment
         variable to define the default setting. For example, you can
         put the following in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.

             SET GIFLINK=-tm -v800 -k

         This command enables direct Telemate support, uses 800x600 256
         color display modem and erases partially received files.


     Auto Download Sequence

         If you are using GIFLink as your Zmodem protocol driver, you
         should turn OFF the 'Zmodem Auto-Download' option under the
         Telemate Options/Protocol dialog. Otherwise, Telemate internal
         Zmodem will kick in before you can activate GIFLink.

         You can define the Auto Download Sequence as "*^XB00" under
         the Telemate Options/External protocol dialog to activate the
         download process whenever the sequence is received.

     ERRORLEVEL EXIT VALUES
     __________________________________________________________________


         When exit, GIFLINK sets the ERRORLEVEL exit value to one of
         the following:

         0, Success: All files are transferred successfully.

         1, Failure: Any error that aborts the program, for example,
         invalid command line, file not found, not enough memory or a
         failure in transmission.


     GIFLINK                                             EXAMPLES    19


     EXAMPLES
     __________________________________________________________________


      1. The simplest form of GIFLINK is

             GIFLINK rz

         In this example, GIFLink receives (downloads) from the remote
         system using Zmodem. It uses the following default setting:

             COM Port                  COM1 (unless DSZPORT is defined)
             Baud rate                 Current speed in COM1
             Connection                Modem
             Display mode              640x480 256 color (or lower)
             Zmodem recovery           Off
             GIF recovery              Off
             Direct Telemate support   Off
             16550 FIFO buffer         On (if found)
             RTS/CTS flow control      On (if CTS is active initially)
             Slow handshake            Off
             Keep partial              On
             Delete received           Off
             DSZ-type Log              Off (unless DSZLOG is defined)
             Wait time after file      1 seconds


      2. The following illustrates the use of COM2 and Zmodem crash
         recovery.

             GIFLINK -p2 rz -r

         In this example, GIFLink receives files using COM2 at the
         current speed. Zmodem with crash recovery is used. Although it
         resumes an aborted transfer, it does not display an interrupt
         GIF image. If you want to display the interrupted GIF image
         before the resume process, you should use the -rg GIF recovery
         options. For example,

             GIFLINK -p2 rz -rg


      3. For Ymodem-G with slow handshake,

             GIFLINK -hs -fD:\DOWNLOAD rb -g
             GIFLINK -hs -fD:\DOWNLOAD rg

         Both commands use Ymodem-G with slow handshake. COM activity
         is suspended during disk I/O. It prevents any conflict of the
         COM and disk activity. If you are using a disk cache software,
         you should disable the caching mechanism before running
         GIFLink.

         The -fD:\DOWNLOAD option also tells GIFLink to put the
         received file into the D:\DOWNLOAD directory.


     GIFLINK                                             EXAMPLES    20


      4. For Xmodem with a FOSSIL connection,

             GIFLINK -cF -k rx D:\DOWNLOAD\GIFLINK.GIF

         This example uses Xmodem and saves the received file into
         D:\DOWNLOAD\GIFLINK.GIF. The -cF option tells GIFLink to use a
         FOSSIL driver to talk to the modem. The -k option erases
         partially received file.


      5. In case if you do not want to keep the received files,

             GIFLINK -d rb

         This example uses Batch Ymodem to transfer the files. The -d
         option allows you to delete the current file after it is
         received! It is very useful when you have limited disk space
         or do not wish to keep the GIF images being transmitted.


      6. If you are using a black and white monitor,

             GIFLINK -m -fifo sy GIFLINK.GIF

         This example sends GIFLINK.GIF files using Ymodem. The -m
         option tells GIFLink to display the GIF image in 64 grey-scale
         level. The -fifo option disables the 16550 FIFO buffer.


      7. To generate a DSZ-type log file,

             GIFLINK -l\COMM\DSZ.LOG sb @LIST.TXT

         This example sends all the files specified in LIST.TXT using
         Batch Ymodem and creates a \COMM\DSZ.LOG log file in DSZ
         format. If you want to create a Telemate usage log, you should
         use the -tm option. For example,

             GIFLINK -tm\TELEMATE\TM.CFG sb @LIST.TXT

         The command creates a Telemate usage log TM.USE in the
         Telemate log directory.


      8. To send or receive file using CompuServe QuickB, you should
         first select upload or download and enter the file name in the
         CompuServe command line, then run GIFLink.

             GIFLINK qb

         Note: You should NOT use the internal CompuServe QuickB as the
         default protocol in your communication programs.



     GIFLINK                                             EXAMPLES    21


      9. If you want to preview the GIF images you are going to sent,
         or look at the received images,

             GIFLINK -v800 -w10 view *.GIF

         The view command displays all the GIF images in the current
         directory. The -v800 option specifies the 800x600 256 color
         display mode. The -w10 option specifies a 10 seconds delay
         after each GIF image.

     WHAT IS TELEMATE

         Telemate is a full featured communications program with an
         easy-to-learn and easy-to-use integrated environment. Its
         multithreading feature allows you to prepare messages, view
         files while you are downloading and printing files. Each task
         run in its own movable and resizable window. The Windows-like
         mouse interfaces let you complete a connection and select
         options without touching a key.

         The back scroll buffer works just like the built-in editor and
         viewer and you can save parts of the content to files. Through
         the clipboard, you can cut and paste text among windows and
         quote message from the back scroll buffer to the remote
         system.

         Telemate has the most popular protocols built-in, including
         Zmodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem, Kermit and CompuServe QuickB.
         Writing a script program is as simple as writing a BASIC or
         PASCAL program. The learn script mode can also generate script
         files for you.

     What's Special in Telemate?

       Integrated Environment: Telemate is much more than a tele-
         communications program. Telemate is a flexible, full featured
         environment, with an interface that is easy to learn and use.
         An editor, viewer and mouse support are built into Telemate.
         All of these features are accessible from menus and keyboard.

       Multithreading: Telemate has multithreading (or internal
         multitasking) built-in. While you are dialing or downloading,
         you can prepare messages, view files, or scroll back to the
         last connection. You can have them all at the same time,
         running in their own windows.

       Mouse Support: While the other communication programs still
         require a mouse-menu TSR to emulate their function keys,
         Telemate considers the mouse as an integral part of its
         design, providing a smooth user interface, regardless of the
         input method you prefer.

       Built-in Editor and Viewer: The editor allows you to prepare
         your messages, edit documents or type letters. And the viewer
         can display files without disturbing the editor.

       Back Scroll: The very large back scroll buffer works just like
         an editor. Portions of the buffer can be saved to disk. By
         pressing just a few keys, you can tag file names, quote a
         message and search the buffer for matches.

       Clipboard: Through the clipboard, you can cut and paste text
         among windows. You can prepare a message in the editor and
         then copy or paste it to the terminal, or you can tag file
         names from the back scroll buffer and paste them to the
         terminal.

       File Transfer Protocols: Telemate has the most popular protocols
         built-in, including Zmodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem, Kermit and
         CompuServe QuickB. In addition, there are eight slots for
         external protocols.

       Easy-to-learn Script Language: Writing a Telemate script program
         is as simple as writing a BASIC or PASCAL program. If you
         don't have any programming experience, the Learn Script mode
         can generate script files for you.

       Enhanced Video support: Without any additional hardware,
         Telemate lets you select a screen height from 25 to 32 lines
         on your normal CGA adapter and 7 choices of screen height on
         an EGA or VGA adapter.

     WHAT IS GIFLINK

         GIFLink is an easy to use protocol driver that allows you to
         view the transmitting GIF images in stunning SuperVGA
         graphics. And it is the first protocol driver that uses full
         screen computer graphics in SuperVGA mode.

         GIFLink supports most of the popular file transfer protocols
         such as Zmodem, Batch Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem and CompuServe
         QuickB. If the files being transmitted are not GIF images,
         GIFLink will work just like a normal protocol driver. So
         GIFLink will transmit any files, not just GIF images.

         GIFLink also has a special VIEW mode so that you can look at
         the received GIF images in a slideshow format or preview the
         images you are going to sent.


     WHAT IS GIFLITE

         GIFLITE is a high quality GIF-to-GIF image compression
         program. It compresses the GIF files so that they will require
         much less disk space yet still preserve the same quality and
         resolution.

         With GIFLITE, digitized GIF images can be further compressed
         by an average of 30%. What makes GIFLITE special is that the
         resulting GIF files are almost identical to the original file.
         Human eyes can hardly tell them apart.

         GIFLITE conforms to both GIF87a and GIF89a standards. All non-
         image information is preserved in the resulting GIF files. The
         compressed images can be read by standard GIF decoders, such
         as VPIC v4+, CSHOW v8.3+ and GIFLink.

         Using GIFLITE is much like using the other file compressors.
         If you have used any file compressor, you will find yourself
         already familiar with the command structure and options.
