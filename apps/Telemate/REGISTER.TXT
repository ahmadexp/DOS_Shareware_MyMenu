    Telemate is NOT FREE. You MUST REGISTER after the 30-day evaluation
    period.

    Telemate is a Shareware product. It is distributed through public
    access channels so that prospective buyers can have the opportunity to
    evaluate the product before making a decision to buy. If you decide to
    use this software, then you are under both legal and moral obligations
    to register it with the author. It is fully protected by State,
    Federal and International copyright laws.

    If you continue to use Telemate after the 30-day evaluation period you
    must register it.

        Registration Fee  :     US$ 49 / CAD$ 55

    To register your copy of Telemate, fill in the order form and mail
    it along with your cheque or money order in US or CAD funds to the
    address of the appropriate RegSite of your choice as indicated in
    the form. Because of the high service charge to collect cheques
    from overseas, we only accept overseas orders in the form of
    international Money Order or Credit Card.  All Money Orders and
    cheques should be made payable to the appropriate RegSite that you
    select to use.

    CompuServe users can register Telemate with CompuServe's shareware
    registration service. GO SWREG and search for Telemate.

    For credit card orders, please call RegSites.

    When you register, you will receive the program diskettes with the
    latest version and your registration number. Registration entitles
    you to continue using the current version and all future DOS
    versions. The registration number will remove any annoying functions
    in the unregistered version of all Telemate releases.

    As a registered user, you can write to us or call the support BBS's
    if you have any questions or problems. We appreciate suggestions and
    ideas; most new Telemate features come from user feedback.
