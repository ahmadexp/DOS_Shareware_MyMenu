TELEMATE                                                 INTRODUCTION    1


INTRODUCTION
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ

What's Special?

Integrated Environment: Telemate is much more than a communications
    program. Telemate is a flexible, full featured environment, with an
    interface that is easy to learn and use. An editor, viewer and mouse
    support are built into Telemate. All of these features are accessible
    from menus and keyboard.

Multithreading: Telemate has multithreading (or internal multitasking)
    built-in. While you are dialing or downloading, you can prepare
    messages, view files, or scroll back to the last connection. You can
    have them all at the same time, running in their own windows.

Mouse Support: While the other communication programs still require a
    mouse-menu TSR to emulate their function keys, Telemate considers the
    mouse as an integral part of its design, providing a smooth user
    interface, regardless of the input method you prefer.

Built-in Editor and Viewer: The editor allows you to prepare your
    messages, edit documents or type letters. And the viewer can display
    files without disturbing the editor.

Back Scroll: The very large back scroll buffer works just like an editor.
    Portions of the buffer can be saved to disk. By pressing just a few
    keys, you can tag file name, quote a message and search the buffer
    for matches.

Clipboard: Through the clipboard, you can cut and paste text among
    windows. You can prepare a message in the editor and then copy or
    paste it to the terminal, or you can tag file names from the back
    scroll buffer and paste them to the terminal.

File Transfer Protocols: Telemate has the most popular protocols built-in,
    including Zmodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem, Kermit and CompuServe QuickB. In
    addition, there are eight slots for external protocols.

Easy-to-learn Script Language: Writing a Telemate script program is as
    simple as writing a BASIC program. If you don't have any programming
    experience, the Learn Script mode can generate script files for you.

Enhanced Video support: Without any additional hardware, Telemate lets you
    select a screen height from 25 to 32 lines on your normal CGA adapter
    and 7 choices of screen height on an EGA or VGA adapter.

GETTING STARTED

Requirements

    Telemate requires an IBM PC/AT/fully compatible computer, PC-DOS or
    MS-DOS version 3.00 or greater, a minimum of 500K of memory and a
    modem.

    Optional: Telemate makes full use of a mouse if present and runs on
    Monochrome, CGA, EGA or VGA systems. Up to 8MB expanded memory (EMS
    3.2 or up) and 8MB extended memory with XMS driver is supported.


Installing Telemate

    The following steps show how to install Telemate on the C drive of
    your hard disk drive. You can use any other drive by substituting the
    letter of your drive in place of C in the example below.

      1) Check to be sure you are logged on the C drive and on the root
         directory. To be sure you are at the root directory type CD \.

      2) Make a subdirectory for the Telemate files by typing MD \TM. If
         you already have a directory you wish to use for Telemate, change
         to that directory and skip to step 4.

      3) Change to the Telemate directory by typing CD \TM .

      4) Place the Telemate disk #1 in drive A and copy the Telemate files
         to this directory by typing COPY A:\*.* C:\TM . Repeat this step
         until all disks are copied.

      5) To start the installation program, type TMINST and press [Enter].

    To help Telemate locate the configuration file that TMINST creates,
    add the following line to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

           SET TMCFG=C:\TM\TM.CFG

    This will enable Telemate to run from any directory or from a menu
    system.

    If your COMMAND.COM is not located in the root directory, you should
    also include the line

           SET COMSPEC=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM

    in AUTOEXEC.BAT, assuming COMMAND.COM is in the C:\DOS directory.

THE INSTALLATION PROGRAM
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ

    The installation program TMINST.EXE, creates the configuration file
    TM.CFG and the phone directory TM.FON. Some options must be defined
    before you run Telemate. Two examples are the memory usage and the
    window colors. Some options can be defined after installation using
    the Option dialogs inside Telemate.

    When you first run TM.EXE, it will automatically chain to TMINST.EXE
    so that you can setup the options. If you want to change some options
    later, you can run TMINST.EXE separately.

    Once you have started the installation program the following will
    appear on your screen.

Dial Prefixes and Dial Suffixes
     ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø     Dial Prefixes refer to the string Telemate
     ≥ ATDT          ≥     sends just prior to dialing a number.
     ≥ ATDP          ≥     If you have a pulse phone, (check with your

     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ     service, then select "ATDT".

    Dial Suffixes refer to the signal Telemate sends after the phone
    number. Usually, it is simply a carriage return: "^M".

    The content of the prefixes and suffixes can be modified in
    Option/Dial Setup dialog in Telemate at any time.

Flow control
     ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø    XON/XOFF software flow control is usually
     ≥ XON/XOFF   OFF ≥    used by networks while the RTS/CTS hardware
     ≥ RTS/CTS    OFF ≥    control is used by high speed modems.
     ≥ 16550 FIFO  ON ≥
     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ    If the modem is an error correcting modem,
                           such as an MNP modem, RTS/CTS should be ON,
                           XON/XOFF should be off.

    16550 FIFO refers to the First In/First Out data buffer of NS16550AN
    UART chip. If your serial adapter is equipped with this chip, you
    should turn it ON. This will prevent data overruns caused by disk
    access or the overhead of the multitasker.

Base Address, IRQ & Interrupt

    The default setting for COM1 to COM4 is probably suitable for most
    modems. For details on the setting of your modem, please refer to the
    modem's documentation. Normally, the interrupt number is the IRQ
    number plus 8. For example, IRQ 5 uses the interrupt number 13. High
    IRQ from 8 to 15 use the interrupt numbers from 112 to 119. For
    example, IRQ 9 uses the interrupt number 113.

    The setting being selected corresponds to the current COM port you
    have chosen. You can use different settings for the other COM ports by
    selecting the "other COM port" item from the menu. If the setting for
    your modem is not shown in the menu, you can modify the following line
    in the configuration file, TM.CFG.

        COMx=3f8,12,4

    The first item is the base address, the second is the interrupt number
    and the third the IRQ number.

     ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø    Telemate lets you choose from a variety of
     ≥ 25             ≥    video heights. Video height refers to the
     ≥ 26 CGA,EGA,VGA ≥    number of lines of text on your screen.
     ≥ 27 CGA,EGA,VGA ≥    28 lines is recommended: 1 line for
     ≥ 28 CGA,EGA,VGA ≥    the menu bar, 1 for the bottom status

Video Cache, Scroll Bar, Snow Check and Date Format

    On systems with a slower screen update rate, such as MS Windows or a
    slower computer, Video Cache should be ON and Telemate only update the
    screen after scrolling several lines. This improves system performance
    although the screen may appear a little jumpy.

     ⁄ƒƒƒ Display ƒƒƒƒƒƒø  Telemate uses a graphical scroll bar that
     ≥ Video Type       ≥  allows you to scroll through files using a
     ≥ Video Height     ≥  mouse. If you don't plan to use a mouse
     ≥ Video Cache  OFF ≥  with Telemate you may wish to turn this
     ≥ Scroll Bar    ON ≥  feature off.
     ≥ Snow Check   OFF ≥
     ≥ Date Format      ≥  Original CGA display adapters exhibit 'snow'
     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ  while accessing the video memory. In this case,
                           the Snow Check option should be ON. Newer CGA
    adapters do not have this problem and display speed will be improved
    if this option is OFF. Note: This option applies to CGA only.

    Telemate supports 9 date formats which can be divided into 3 groups.
    The first group uses '-' as the separator, the second uses the '/' and
    the third uses '.'. These formats should support virtually any
    country.

     ≥ COM 1 ≥             If your mouse is a Microsoft mouse,
     ≥ COM 2 ≥             there is no need to select a port because
     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ             the mouse driver will detect it.

Mouse Speed
     ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø            If you find that the mouse cursor is too
     ≥ Fast   ≥            fast, you can slow it down by selecting
     ≥ Medium ≥            the Slow option. To move the cursor faster,
     ≥ Slow   ≥            select the Fast option. If your mouse is a
     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ            Microsoft mouse, there is no need to use
                           this option because the mouse driver allows
                           you to set the speed.

Printer

     ⁄ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒø             Telemate supports both printer ports.
     ≥ NULL  ≥             Most users have their pointer connected

     ¿ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒŸ             Print function will not work anymore.

Memory

    Telemate will make use of extended and/or expanded memory if present
    in your system. This reduces the conventional memory requirements.
    Refer to the appendix for a description of these memory specifications
    and details on optimizing the memory usage.

    If 64K is selected, 16 pages of video memory is used. However, this
    setup is not compatible with any memory resident programs or the
    [PrtSc] command because the address of the video buffer is changed.
    Unless Telemate is in 43 or 50 line mode and you are very low on
    memory, the 32K mode should be selected for compatibility. Please
    refer to the appendix for more information.

    If Telemate is running under Windows, DESQView or in 132 column mode,
    this option is automatically set to 0K in order to maintain

Edit Menu

    If the Indent option is on, the editor will start in Auto-indent mode.
    In this mode, pressing [Enter] will place the cursor at the first non-
    blank column instead of the beginning of the line. This is useful for
    programming Telemate scripts or source code in other languages.

    If the Backup option is on, the editor will make a backup copy, of the
    file being edited when the file is saved. The extension .BAK will be
    used.


Back Menu

    If the Scroll Lock option is on, the cursor in the Back window will
    stay at the previous position when the Back window is being brought to
    the top of the screen. If this option is off, Telemate will start at
    the bottom of the Back window instead.

    If the Capture option is on, incoming data will be put to the back
    scroll buffer. If you are using a floppy system, this option should be
    turned off to prevent disk access.

    Telemate requires the following files for ANSI-BBS terminal emulation.

            TM.EXE    -   Telemate main program
            TM.OVL    -   overlay module
            TM.CFG    -   configuration file
            TM.RES    -   resource file
            TM.FON    -   phone directory
            TM.MEM    -   memo field (if any)
            ANSI.MAC  -   ANSI terminal macro
            ANSI.PAD  -   ANSI terminal keypad

    If you run script files, the following files are necessary.

            TMS.EXE      -  the script compiler
            *.SCR        -  the script you write
            *.TMS        -  the compiled script generated by TMS.EXE

    Four temporary files may be created while Telemate is running and will
    be deleted when Telemate exits. It is very important that at least 128
    Kbytes of disk space is available for these files. If the 'Swap to
    disk' option is on, another 128K is required.

           TM.VM?        -  virtual memory in disk
           TM.SWP        -  image of the swap portion (in DOS shell)
           TMCLIP.$$$    -  image of clipboard for printing
           A???????.     -  image of the Telemate (in Max DOS shell)


Executing Telemate on a Dual 360K Floppy Disk System

    The following suggestions will help in using Telemate on computers
    that are not equipped with a hard drive.

    When using a floppy disk system, you should set the back scroll line
    limit to 50 or 100 so that no disk access is required for capture
    Otherwise, these disk accesses will slow down Telemate's operation and
    cause data to be lost. Enabling the XON/XOFF flow control may help
    prevent this from happening.

    You should not remove or change the diskette in drive A: because
    Telemate requires disk space as virtual memory. The overlay module of
    Telemate is on the diskette too.

    Caution: Changing the diskette in drive A: may corrupted the file
    directory of the new diskette.


TELEMATE                                          EXECUTING TELEMATE    17


    Define the 'Virtual Memory Directory' to 'A:\' and limit the number of
    files on the floppy. Do not change the disk indicated in the virtual
    memory directory.

            A:\     TM.OVL, TM.CFG, TM.FON, TM.MEM, TM.CFG, TM.RES,
                    ANSI.MAC, ANSI.PAD, TMS.EXE, *.SCR, *.TMS
            B:\     TM.EXE

    After setting up the files on the diskettes, you should

      1) Place disk #1 in the A: drive and disk #2 in the B: drive.
      2) Type B:TM on the DOS command line since the main program
         TM.EXE is in disk #2.

    After loading Telemate, you may replace disk #2 with a working disk
    for downloading, file editing or other purposes.


Executing Telemate on a 720, 1.2M or 14.4M Floppy Disk System

    Like the 360K floppy disk system, you should make as much space as
    possible for the virtual memory directory. You may put the TM.EXE in
    A: since there should be enough memory. The documents should not be
    included.

    If you have only two floppy drives, you should place a blank disk in
    drive B: and set the 'Virtual Memory Directory' to 'B:\'.


Executing Telemate on a Hard Disk System

    To execute Telemate on a hard disk system

      1) Type CD \TM to change to the Telemate directory
      2) Type TM on the DOS command line


Command Line Options

    Telemate accepts several command line options. These options tell
    Telemate to carry out certain commands when the program is loaded.
    Below is a description of these options:

Terminal Option   /T

    If the Terminal Option is used, Telemate starts at the Terminal window
    instead of the Dial window.


TELEMATE                                          EXECUTING TELEMATE    18


Already Online Option   /O

    If you have already been online before executing Telemate, you should
    use 'TM /O' at the DOS prompt to start Telemate. The modem
    initialization string is not sent. In addition, the current COM port
    parameters are used.

No Init Option   /N

    Similar to the '/O' option, except that it uses the COM port
    parameters as specified in the configuration file.

Auto Dial Option   /D

    Telemate starts dialing automatically using the saved dial list after
    sending the modem initialization string.

Full Screen Option   /F   [Alt -]

    If the Full Screen Option is on, the menu bar is hidden. If you are
    editing a file and need the extra line, this option gives you back
    that extra line. Pressing [Alt -] in Telemate toggles the status line
    and the menu bar. On some foreign keyboards, [Alt +] is the equivalent
    key.

Windows Compatibility Option   /W

    If this option is on, Telemate will enable the transmit interrupt
    under Windows for high speed transmission. By default, Telemate does
    not use the transmit interrupt when running under Windows because it
    may lock up some computers completely. This option can be added to the
    TELEMATE.PIF if Telemate can run with it under Windows.

Load Phone Directory   /=<.FON phone directory>

    To load a different phone directory on the command line, the name of
    the phone directory should be placed after the '/=' command switch.
    For example, typing "TM /=NEW" will load the NEW.FON and NEW.MEM files
    to the Dial window.

Auto Script   <.SCR script file>

    To execute a script file automatically, the name of the script file
    should be placed after the "TM" on the command line. For example,
    typing "TM host" at the DOS command line starts Telemate and runs the
    Host mode.

    The keyboard and mouse are considered primary input devices. All
    functions can be accessed with a keyboard as well as a mouse. You can
    use Telemate's power and shortcut keys to speed through all functions.
    If you do have a mouse, you will find Telemate extremely easy and even
    fun to use.

    Telemate can operate with either a two-button or three-button mouse
    that is compatible with the Microsoft driver or a MouseSystem's mouse.
    To use a MouseSystem compatible mouse with Telemate, simply start the
    program. There is no need to load a mouse driver. If your mouse is a
    Microsoft or compatible, you will need to load your mouse driver
    program before starting Telemate.


Terminology

    Clicking: refers to depressing the mouse button one time and
    releasing.

    Double-Clicking: the action of clicking the mouse button twice, very
    quickly. This is usually used to indicate an action or selection.

    Dragging: means to hold the mouse button down while moving the mouse,
    thus "dragging" something on screen to a different screen position.

    Pointing: refers to moving the mouse so that the mouse cursor rests on
    or "points" at something on screen.


Three Button Mice

    A three button mouse operates in the following manner:

    Left Button (the main button):

         MARK text in the Edit, View, and Back windows.
         SELECT in pull down Menus and the Dial & Macro windows.
         CUT and PASTE text in the Terminal window.

    Middle Button: works like the [Esc] key.

    Right Button:

         COPY and PASTE text between the other windows and the
         Terminal window.



TELEMATE                                         IF YOU HAVE A MOUSE    20


Two Button Mice

    If your mouse has only two buttons, the left button is the main button
    and the right button becomes the [Esc] button.


The Window Borders

    In Telemate, the window borders are mouse sensitive. Clicking the main
    mouse key on the window borders performs various functions:

         Top Border :          Move window
         Top-Left corner :     Close window
         Top-Right corner :    Zoom window
         Bottom-Right corner : Resize window
         Bottom Border:        Scroll horizontally
         Right Border:         Scroll vertically


The Scroll Bar

    When the scroll bar option is turned on, the top window has enlarged
    right and bottom borders, called scroll bars.

    To scroll vertically with the mouse, point at the "scroll box" (the
    dark box inside the scroll bar) and while holding down the left mouse
    button, drag it to a position in the scroll bar that corresponds to
    the general location in the file you wish to display. The same process
    can be used to scroll horizontally in a file using the dark box on the
    bottom scroll bar.

    To scroll one line or one character at a time, click on the arrows at
    either end of the scroll bars. To scroll one page at a time, click on
    the region between the scroll box and the arrows at end of the scroll
    bar.

    Telemate uses windows to present various kinds of information and
    perform different functions. The major windows are listed in the menu
    bar on the top of the screen. They are: Dial, Terminal, Edit, View,
    Back and Macro. The current time is displayed in the upper right
    corner.

    The following is a description of how to interact with the window and
    menu system in Telemate. The first paragraph of each section describes
    keyboard use. The following paragraph begins with the word "Mouse:"
    and describes the equivalent methods using the mouse. You should be
    aware that some ALT-key commands have different meanings in different
    windows.

Opening a Window

    Each major window in Telemate has an accompanying pull down menu. To
    use a window, simply type the first letter of the window's name while
    holding down the [Alt] key. For example, to use the Edit window type
    [Alt E].

    Mouse: With the mouse cursor on the name of the window, click the left
    button to activate the window.

Selecting a Window

    When a window is already on the screen, pressing the [Alt] key and the
    first letter of the window's name moves that window to the top and
    makes it the active window.

    Mouse: You can select a window by moving the mouse cursor inside the
    window and clicking.

Pull Down Menus

    Typing the Alt-letter sequence twice brings up the pull down menu for
    the corresponding window. For example, if you press the [Alt E] twice,
    the first press causes the Edit window to appear, the second brings up
    the Edit menu.

    Mouse: With the window open, click on the Window menu a second time
    and the pull down menu appears.


TELEMATE                                  USING THE TELEMATE WINDOWS    22


Zooming a Window [Alt Z]

    Zooming a window can be accomplished in two ways. The fastest method
    is to hit the [Alt Z] key. Immediately, the top window fills the
    screen. Invoking the Window menu by pressing [Alt W], and selecting
    the Zoom command have the same effect.

    Mouse: Clicking the mouse on the upper right corner of the window will
    invoke the Zoom command.

Moving a Window

    When you have more than one window open at a time, windows may become
    covered. If you want to check the information behind the top window,
    you can move the window to a new position on the screen.

    To move a window, press the [Alt W] key to open the Window menu and
    select the Move command. The window border is highlighted and you can
    use the cursor keys to indicate the new position. Press [Enter] to
    move the window to this location.

    Mouse: Position the mouse cursor on the top border of the window
    border. Drag the outline of the window to the position desired and
    release. The window appears at the new location.

Resizing a Window

    To change the size of a window, open the Window menu by pressing [Alt
    W]. Now select the Resize option. Again the Window border is
    highlighted and you can use the cursor keys to resize it. Press the
    [Enter] key to effect the resize.

    Mouse: Position the mouse cursor on the lower right hand corner of the
    window border. Drag the outline of the window until the outline is the
    size you desire, then release.

Closing a Window

    To close a window, press the [Esc] key.

    Mouse: Hitting the [Esc] button or clicking on the upper left corner
    of the border close the window.

    There are several functions that do not belong to any task and have
    their own window or dialog.


DOS Command [Alt R]

    This is a full screen DOS command function. Several DOS commands can
    be executed without shelling to DOS and three commands are added.

    If an external command or a program name is entered, Telemate will
    shell to DOS, execute it and return as quickly as possible. The screen
    is preserved and shown in the DOS window.

    This window also stores the last 10 commands. You can recall them by
    pressing [Up] key. The [Left] and [Right] keys allow you to edit the
    command line.

    The COPY command does not accept parameters such as '/a', '/b' and it
    does not support CON as a file.

    The DEL command supports the '/p' option.

    The DIR command only supports the '/p' and '/w' options.

    The REN command can only rename one file at a time.

    In the cases that one or more options are not supported, Telemate will
    shell to DOS automatically and execute the command. If there is enough
    memory, no swapping will be performed so that a simple DOS command can
    be executed as quickly as possible.

    The INS command accepts '/p' as a parameter which pauses when the
    screen is full.

Jumping to DOS [Alt J]

    Pressing [Alt J] lets you jump to a DOS shell. The DOS prompt is
    visible and any DOS command or program can be executed. To return to
    Telemate, type 'EXIT' and press the Enter key.


File Directory [Alt F]

    The File Directory function (or File dialog) is used to load or save
    files.

    There are two ways to specify the file you want to load using the
    keyboard:

      1) Type the name of the file or directory in the text box, then
         press [Enter].

      2) Press the [Tab] key to move the cursor to the file list box, then
         use the arrow keys to move through the list box until the file or
         the directory you want is highlighted. Press [Enter] to select
         the file or change to the directory.

    Mouse: Point at the file name you want to load in the list box, then
    double-click the mouse button.

    When uploading files, you can select multiple files by pressing
    [Spacebar] in the file list box.

    Mouse: For multiple files, point at the file name and click the mouse
    button while holding down the [Shift] key.

    When the File dialog appears, the file names and directories are
    displayed in columns in the list box. If you select the 'Display All
    Information' option, you can show all of the information for these
    files. This information includes the size, transfer time, and the
    file's date and time.

    Mouse: Point at the check box with the title: 'Display All
    Information' and click the mouse button.

    [BackSpace] clears the entire File Name field if it is the first key
    pressed. Otherwise, it deletes the character at the left of the
    cursor. To delete the last character, you can press [End] first and
    then [BackSpace].

    [Ctrl Y] clears the entire File Name field. You may type in the full
    DOS path and file name.

    When Telemate is first loaded, the phone directory appears on the
    screen unless you override it using the '/T', '/O' or '/N' command
    line option.

    The phone directory can hold up to 1000 entries and you can have
    multiple directories. The default is 100 entries. You can change this
    size with the phone directory maintenance program TMPHONE.EXE.


Directory Functions

    A phone directory entry consists of: Name, Password, Phone number,
    Script, Log, Parameters, Total, Last Connect date, and Memo. Not all
    fields are displayed on the screen in the Dial Window. You can press
    the [Right] or [Left] keys to display other fields.

[Esc]: The [Esc] key hides the Dial window.

[Space]: [Spacebar] toggles the entry under the dial bar. A check mark is
    placed next to the selected entries. Typing the number corresponding
    to the directory entry also selects the entry. You may enter more than
    one choice by separating each with a space. Press [Enter] to accept
    the choice and begin dialing.

[Enter]: The directory entry you previously chose reappears. Press [Enter]
    again to redial. To change the entry simply type in the number of the
    entry you wish to dial.

[Ins]: Pressing the [Ins] key clears the dial list, inserts the entry
    under the dial bar and quickly starts dialing.

[Left], [Right]: The complete phone directory is wider than the screen.
    Pressing the [Left] or [Right] keys will show portions of the
    directory not currently on screen.

[Home], [End]: These keys move the dial bar to the directory's first and
    last entries respectively. The [Ctrl PgUp] and [Ctrl PgDn] are
    equivalent to [Home] and [End] respectively.

[Up], [Page Up]; [Down], [Page Down]: Using the up and down arrows moves
    the dial bar to the previous or next entry. The [PgUp] and [PgDn] keys
    move through the directory one page at a time.

    Mouse: Clicking on a directory entry sends that entry to the dial
    list. Clicking once in the top portion of the Dial window or double
    clicking an entry will start dialing.

Dialing Functions

    After you have selected the numbers, Telemate starts dialing and the
    top section of the Dial window lists the following functions:

Attempt #: This shows the current number of attempts made to reach a
    certain number. You can define the maximum number of attempts that
    Telemate should perform through the Options/Dial Setup dialog.

Elapsed Time: The first number listed is the amount of time which has
    elapsed on this attempt. The second number is the amount of time
    Telemate waits before terminating the attempt. Telemate continues to
    dial a number until a connection is made, the process is canceled, or
    the break string is received. You can change the dial time by pressing
    the [+] or [-] keys.

Last Attempt: A message appears in this area which gives the result of the
    last dialing attempt.

[+], [-]: These keys adjust the amount of time in seconds Telemate will
    wait while attempting to make a connection.

[Space]: This key cancels the current attempt and recycles to the next
    entry in the dial list.

[Esc]: Pressing the [Esc] key cancels the dialing process.

[Enter]: Pressing [Enter] has the same effect as [Esc] except that the
    line is not disconnected. This is useful when making voice calls: when
    the connection is made, you can pick up the phone and press [Enter] to
    begin talking.

[Del]: This key deletes the current entry from the dial list.

[Ins]: This key inserts the entry under the dial bar at the end of the
    dial list.

    Mouse: While dialing, a click on the top section performs a recycle
    function and a click on the bottom section inserts the entry under the
    dial bar at the end of the dial list.

Save Dial List [F2]

    [F2] saves the dial list state to the configuration file. The next
    time you run Telemate, the dial list is restored. This also saves your
    phone directory window display. For example, if you want Telemate to
    display the directory password fields in all sessions, scroll sideways
    until the password field is visible, then press [F2].

Load Phone Directory [F3]

    Telemate allows you to access multiple phone directories using the
    [F3] key.

Find [F4]

    Selecting this item, you will see the prompt "Find: _". Type in the
    text you wish to find. The search is not case sensitive. To search the
    entire directory, press the [Home] key. This will show the beginning
    of the directory allowing you to search all entries.

Next [F5]

    Pressing [F5] finds the next occurrence of the text found.

Quick Find [A] - [Z]

    When you hit a letter key, the dial bar will jump to the next entry
    starting with that letter. For example, [D] finds the entry starting
    with the letter 'D'.

    Selecting the Edit function allows you to modify your phone directory.
    Pressing [F6] brings the entry under the dial bar to the Phone Entry
    dialog shown at the end of this section.

Goto [F7]

    When you select this option, you are prompted with "Goto # _". Type in
    the entry number you wish to see and press [Enter]. This is very
    useful for large directories. Typing in "150" quickly takes you to
    entry #150.

Manual Dial [F8]

    Choosing this option causes the following to appear at the top of the
    Dial window: "Manual Dial: _". Type in the phone number you wish to
    reach exactly as if you were dialing it from your phone. When you are
    finished, press [Enter] and Telemate will dial the number for you
    using the current dial prefix and suffix.

Revise Script [F9]

    This function calls the editor to load the script file shown in the
    script field. If the editor is already in use, you will be asked if
    you want to save the file being edited.

Append Entries [F10]

    This function appends 10 entries to the phone directory so that new
    entries can be added. To add more than 10 entries, use the phone
    maintenance program TMPHONE.EXE.

Remove Entry

    This function clears the entry under the selection bar.

Hang Up [Alt H]

    This function hangs up the phone.

Learn Script [Alt N]

    Selecting this function will enter the learn script mode using the
    script file in the script field. Telemate will enter learn script mode
    automatically if the related script file is not found.

    Caution: Any existing script file will be erased if you start a learn
    script sequence.

    For a detailed description on using dialog, please refer to 'How to
    Make Changes' in the 'THE OPTION DIALOGS' section.

    Note: You can copy [Alt C] the name and phone number from the Back
    window and paste [Alt P] it into the corresponding field.

Name: Type in the name of the remote system.

Phone: Type in the phone number needed to make the connection. If the
    number has extra information, place them in the dial prefix and dial
    suffix setup fields.

Memo: This space allows you to enter a reminder to yourself. It can
    include any information you need that contains less than 30
    characters.

Password: Telemate helps you keep track of your passwords by making them
    part of your phone directory. Type in the password you use with the
    specific BBS. Telemate uses a special keyboard macro '^&' assigned to
    the [F3] key by default. This macro relates the [F3] key to the
    password field in the phone directory. You can send your password to a
    BBS by pressing [F3].


TELEMATE                                             THE DIAL WINDOW    33


Script: A script is a program which Telemate automatically executes once
    the connection is made. Scripts are useful for automatically logging
    onto a remote system. Specify the script file name, without the
    extension. If the script you specified does not exist in the script
    directory, Telemate will start a Learn Script sequence when the
    connection is made.

Log: Telemate allows you to have individual log files for each directory
    entry. Type in the name of the log file, without the extension. When
    you open the log file, Telemate appends the incoming text to the file
    you have designated.

Port: Port refers to the communications port to which your modem is
    attached. Telemate supports up to 8 different ports. If this option is
    set to 'Default', Telemate will use the current COM port. Note that
    you should use 'Default' only if all the entries are using 'Default'.

Baud Rate: Baud rate refers to the speed used to transfer data. If this
    option is set to 'Default', Telemate will use the current baud rate.
    Note that you should use 'Default' only if all the entries are using
    'Default'. Otherwise, the 'non-default' entries will influence the
    'Default' entries.

Parity: The vast majority of BBS's are set up for no parity. Some online
    service uses Even parity.

Data Bits and Stop Bits: Data bits refers to how many bits of data are
    sent before a stop bit is sent. Data is normally sent in chunks of 9
    bits; 8 data bits and 1 stop bit.

    When you press [Enter], Telemate takes you to the next option screen.
    You can press [Esc] to cancel the changes.

Dial Prefix: Dial prefix is the string to be sent before the phone number.
    Normally, pulse phone uses a prefix "ATDP" and touch-tone phone uses
    "ATDT". You can define the content of the prefix and the suffix in the
    Options/Dial Setup dialog. If this option is set to 'Default',
    Telemate will use the current dial prefix. Note that you should use
    'Default' only if all the entries are using 'Default'.

Dial Suffix: Dial suffix is the string to be sent after the phone number.
    Usually it is simply a carriage return. But some phone companies
    required that a phone card number follow the phone number. The card
    number should be put in the suffix. If this option is set to
    'Default', Telemate will use the current dial suffix. Note that you
    should use 'Default' only if all the entries are using 'Default'.

Terminal: Telemate gives you the choice of the six terminal emulations:
    ANSI, Avatar, Prism, TTY, VT52 and VT102.

Connection: Normally, the connection is Modem. If the COM port is linked
    to a host computer directly through a cable, then you should select
    Computer. In this mode, Telemate does not check the carrier signal and
    no phone number is dialed. BIOS connection only supports up to 9600
    baud but you may experience data loss at 2400 or higher. If you have
    an Enhanced BIOS, the BIOS connection supports up to 38400 baud.
    FOSSIL driver supports up to 38400 baud. If there is any conflict,
    Telemate will switch to Modem connection automatically.

Add Line Feed: Usually, most BBS's add a line feed automatically at the
    end of each line of data. If the BBS referenced in this entry does not
    add line feeds, you can the have Telemate add a line feed to the end
    of each line received.

Add Return: If this options is on, a carriage return [Ctrl M] is supplied
    after a line feed is received.

Auto Log: If this option is turned on, the log file will be opened
    automatically once the connection is made and closed when the carrier
    signal is lost.


TELEMATE                                             THE DIAL WINDOW    35


Auto Wrap: If this option is turned on, after a character reaches column
    80, the next character is wrapped to the new line. Otherwise, the
    cursor stays at column 80.

Destructive BS: If this option is on, backspace [Ctrl H] will destroy the
    character on the left. Otherwise, backspace only moves the cursor to
    the left.

Guess Initial: If this option is turned on, Telemate scans the incoming
    data and looks for 'From:' or 'Name:' and remembers the initials of
    the following name. If there is any chance of a wrong guess, the
    guessing initials will be cleared.

Local Echo: When turned on, the character typed at the keyboard is
    displayed on screen. This is sometimes referred to as half duplex.
    Most BBS's echo the character you type. This is called full duplex. In
    this case, you should leave this option off. Otherwise, the character
    will appear twice on the screen.

Long Distance: You should turn on this option if the phone number is not a
    local call. This field will help utility programs such as TMSTAT.EXE
    to analyze your long distance phone bill.

Strip High Bit: If this option is on, the 8th bit of the incoming data
    will be filtered out. This option is very useful when the actual link
    is 7E1 but you use 8N1 as COM parameter.

File Tag Separator: The tag feature allows you to select the file names in
    the marked text and put them into the clipboard. The file names are
    separated by the tag separator which can be a space, a carriage return
    or a comma depending on the remote system you are using.

Protocol: Different BBS's offer different protocols. You should select the
    one you use most on that BBS as the default protocol. If you choose
    'External', you must specify a letter in the edit box on the right.
    See the appendix for more details on protocols.

    Once you have chosen the protocol you wish to use, you then enter the
    name of file(s) you wish to send. Enter the complete DOS path and file
    name. If you do not include the path, Telemate will search the upload
    path.

    If you are not sure of the filename, press [Enter] and a File dialog
    will appear. In the file list box, you can press [Spacebar] to select
    multiple files.

    You can also prepare a list of names into a file, say c:\upload.lst,
    and use the '@' prefix to indicate that it is a list file. This option
    is especially useful when the files cannot be expressed as a wildcard
    easily. The names in the list file are separated by a space or a
    carriage return and the names can contain wildcard characters. The
    expanded names should not exceed 1024 bytes.


The File Transfer Window

    The File Transfer window keeps you informed regarding the progress of
    an Upload or Download. When batch information is available, an

TELEMATE                                         THE TERMINAL WINDOW    38


Receiving Files [PgDn]

    To download or receive a file with Telemate, you follow much the same
    procedure as when you send files. As in uploading, a protocol menu
    appears after you press [PgDn]. Select the protocol you want to use.
    If the protocol requires a file name, the File Input Box will appear.

Logging Sessions [Alt L]

    This function will record the incoming text into a disk file. If the
    'Log Filter' option is enabled, all control codes will be filtered
    out. If the 'Log Heading' option is turned on, a brief message is
    inserted to the log file indicating the date and time the log is open.
    Log files usually use the extension .LOG. Pressing [Alt L] again
    closes the log file.

Scripts [Alt S]

    A script file is a text file containing a series of instructions which
    are usually automated functions such as a logon script. Script files
    end with the extension .SCR for the source file, and .TMS for the
    compiled file.

    Telemate comes with its own script language. The file TMSCRIPT.DOC
    contains a detailed discussion of Telemate's script language.

    If the compiled script file does not exist or is not up to date,
    Telemate will execute the script compiler TMS.EXE to compile the SCR
    file into a compiled format which it can use.

    To terminate the execution of the script, press [Alt S] again.

Learning Script [Alt N]

    If you are not familiar with writing script files, let Telemate write
    one for you. To do this, press [Alt N] and enter a new name. This
    script name should end in the extension .SCR. Telemate now remembers
    the characters you type. It automatically generates a script file and
    stops learning when you press [Alt N] again or when the connection
    breaks.

    The generated file may not perform exactly the way you like, and
    require modifications before it is used.

Pasting and Quoting

    Telemate allows you to mark and copy text while in the Edit, View and
    Back windows. Marked text is copied to the clipboard. Once the text is
    copied to the clipboard, the Terminal window can handle it in one of
    two ways:

TELEMATE                                         THE TERMINAL WINDOW    39


Pasting [Alt P]

    Pasting text sends the contents of the clipboard to the remote system.
    If the expand blank line option is turned on and blank lines are
    encountered, the blank lines are expanded to lines containing a space.
    This is very similar to an ASCII upload. If you want to send a
    prepared message to the remote system, you can use this function
    instead of an ASCII upload.

Quoting [Alt Q]

    [Alt Q] functions almost the same as [Alt P]. [Alt Q] is designed for
    quoting messages into BBS message areas and the quote prefix is added
    to each line. To quote a message, mark the text from the Back window
    and Copy to the clipboard. Then position the cursor where you want the
    text to go in the remote system and hit [Alt Q]. The quoted message is
    reformatted to line up with the quote margin. If the Initial Guessing
    option is enabled, the '@' character in the quote prefix is replaced
    with the initials of the closest name.

Image Files [Alt I]

    The current screen can be captured into a file with this function.

Command Stack [Alt Y]

    The command stack provides a convenient way to recall the previously
    entered commands or prepare a short note. You can use the command
    stack in several ways:

     ’ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕ—ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕ∏

TELEMATE                                         THE TERMINAL WINDOW    40


    For example, to write a three line note, you could type the following:

     [Ctrl Home]THIS IS THE FIRST LINE [Ctrl Enter]
          THIS IS THE SECOND ONE [Ctrl Enter]
          THIS IS THE LAST ONE   [Ctrl Enter]
     [Up] [Up] [Up] [Enter] [Enter] [Enter]

    The [Ctrl Home] clears the window and lets you start from the top. The
    [Ctrl Enter] performs a line feed but does not send the line. To send
    these lines, you move the cursor to the first line and press [Enter]
    three times.

    Copy and Paste functions are also allowed in this window. The Copy
    [Alt C] function copies the current line to the clipboard.

    The Paste [Alt P] function pastes the clipboard text to the window. If
    there is more than one line in the clipboard, text will be inserted
    until the cursor reaches the bottom of the window.

Chat Mode [Alt C]

    The chat mode splits the screen for online conversations. Text coming
    from the remote system appears on the top half of the screen.
    Characters you type appear on the lower half of the screen and are
    sent to the remote system immediately. To terminate the chat mode,
    press [Alt C] again. To edit the line before sending it to the remote
    system, use the Command Stack [Alt Y] function instead.

Originate Mode [Alt G]

    This is the "normal" mode. You use this mode to call a BBS or a remote
    system. The communication originates from your computer terminal. When
    you start Telemate, you are in this mode. If you are in Answer Mode,
    you can press [Alt G] to switch back to Originate mode by sending the
    Modem Init string to the modem.

Answer Mode [Alt A]

    When you select Answer mode you tell Telemate to send the Auto Answer
    string to the modem which turns on the modem's Auto Answer feature.
    The modem then answers the phone for you. Pressing [Alt G] returns you
    to Originate mode.

    NOTE: Auto answer is designed to receive calls from other computers.
    It does not handle voice calls.


TELEMATE                                         THE TERMINAL WINDOW    41


Doorway Mode [Alt =]

    When you select Doorway mode, Telemate sends the keyboard scan code
    when a key is pressed. That means not only the ASCII characters can be
    sent, but also the function keys and [Alt] keys. For example, if the
    [Alt T] is pressed, the keyboard scan code is sent to the remote
    system and Telemate's Terminal menu will not appear. To terminate
    Doorway mode, press [Alt =] again or use your mouse to select the
    Doorway mode item. The Doorway program requires all 25 lines in the
    Terminal window, so you should press [Alt -] to toggle the menu bar
    and the status line off. On some foreign keyboards, [Alt accent '] is
    equivalent to [Alt =].

Hang Up [Alt H]

    Pressing [Alt H] hangs up the phone by sending the Modem Hangup
    string. Including the "^#" macro symbol in this string drops the DTR
    signal which is the fastest way to hang up the phone. If the Confirm
    Hang Up option is on, you will be prompted to verify this action.

Clear Text [Ctrl Home]

    This function clears the screen and resets Telemate to its default
    colors.

Break Signal [Ctrl End]

    A break is a space between signals on the line. It is often used to
    get the attention of the remote system with which you are
    communicating. Pressing [Ctrl End] sends the break signal to the
    remote system.

Printer Log [Ctrl PrtSc]

    This feature sends all of your communication activity to the printer.
    If you need a hardcopy of an on-screen conversation, turning this
    feature on will log all activity to the printer as it occurs. Pressing
    [Ctrl PrtSc] a second time turns logging off.

    Telemate multithreading ability is best demonstrated in the editing
    and backscroll area. You can transfer files in the background while
    simultaneously editing a file in the foreground.

    To begin editing, press [Alt E] or click the mouse on the Edit item in
    the menu bar which brings up the Edit window.

Status Line

    The first line of the Edit window is the Status line. It consists of
    six items:

      Line 6   Col 1   Total 74     Insert    FEB89.LTR      Marking
      \        /         \  /         |          |             |

     column number     the file.                           marking

    When the editor is in the Insert mode, new characters you enter move
    text to the right. Pressing the [Ins] key changes between Insert and
    Overwrite modes. In Overwrite mode, new text replaces existing text.
    While you are in this mode, the word "Insert" is not shown on the
    status line.

Moving Around

    The following keys can be used to move quickly around the Edit window:

     Vertical Movement               Horizontal Movement

     [Up]    Up one line             [Left]        Left one space

Deleting Text

    You can delete text in the Edit window in the following ways:

     [Del]              deletes character at the cursor or block
     [BackSpace]        deletes character to the left
     [Ctrl T]           deletes word right
     [Ctrl Y]           deletes an entire line
     [Ctrl Q]+[Ctrl Y]  deletes from the cursor to end of line

    Use the Mark [F10] and the [Del] key to delete larger blocks of text.
    Telemate will verify with: "Do you want to delete the block? (Y/N)".

CUA Conventions

    Telemate supports the CUA interface standards for marking and copying
    text. You can use the [Shift] key in conjunction with the cursor-
    movement keys to select text.

     [Ctrl Insert]   copies the marked text to the clipboard
     [Ctrl Del]      cuts the marked text to the clipboard
     [Shift Insert]  pastes the marked text from the clipboard

    Normally, the contents of the clipboard is erased before copying or
    cutting. If you press [Ctrl Insert] or [Ctrl Del] while holding down
    the [Shift] key, the clipboard will not be erased and the marked text
    is appended to the existing clipboard contents instead.

    Note: The CUA guideline uses [Shift Del] to cut the text but Telemate
    uses [Ctrl Del] to allow for the [Shift] combo described above.

 Wordstar Conventions

    Telemate also supports several Wordstar key combinations in its
    editor:

     [^E]    Up one line         [^S]    Left one space
     [^X]    Down one line       [^D]    Right one space
     [^R]    Up one screen       [^A]    Left one word
     [^C]    Down one screen     [^F]    Right one word

Margins

    The left margin in the Edit window is a fixed margin and cannot be
    changed. To change the right margin, use the Options/General dialog.
    Telemate performs a word wrap when characters reach the right margin.
    When you are writing scripts or programs, set the right margin to a
    larger value (e.g. 200) to prevent word wrap.

Mark [F10]

    Before you can work with a block of text you must first define where
    the text block begins and ends. Press [F10] once and use the cursor
    keys to highlight the text you want copied. Pressing [F10] again
    unmarks the selected text.

    Mouse: Pressing the left button of your mouse and dragging the mouse
    over the desired text quickly marks large blocks of text.

Copy [Alt C] [Shift Alt C]

    Once the text is marked, press [Alt C] to copy the marked text in the
    clipboard. The text in the clipboard can then be pasted or quoted into
    other windows or to other portions of the file. If you hold down the
    [Shift] key while you press [Alt C], the marked text will be appended
    to the existing contents of the clipboard.

    Mouse: Holding down the [Shift] key while selecting the Copy item from
    the menu has the same effect as [Shift Alt C].

cUt [Alt U] [Shift Alt U]

    The cUt function allows you to move marked text from the file you are
    editing. As with the Copy option, text must first be marked using
    [F10] before it can be cut. The cut text can be pasted into other
    sections of the file using the paste feature. If you hold down the
    [Shift] key while you press [Alt U], the marked text will be appended
    to the existing contents of the clipboard.

    Mouse: Holding down the [Shift] key while selecting the cUt item from
    the menu has the same effect as [Shift Alt U].

Tag [Alt G] [Shift Alt G]

    The tag feature allows you to select the file names in the marked text
    and put them into the clipboard. The file names are separated by the
    tag separator which can be a space, a carriage return or a comma. If
    you hold down the [Shift] key while you press [Alt G], the file names
    will be appended to the clipboard without erasing the clipboard. This
    function is very useful when you want to download a filename shown on
    the screen.

    Mouse: Holding down the [Shift] key while selecting the Tag item from
    the menu has the same effect as [Shift Alt G].

Paste [Alt P]

    Text that is contained in the clipboard can be pasted [Alt P] into
    another window, another section of the same file, or into an entirely
    different file. After marking and copying the text, position the
    cursor where you want the text to go and press [Alt P]. The text is
    pasted at the new location. You can use the cut function with paste to
    move text within a file. If you wish to copy text to a new file, mark
    and copy the text first. Then load the new file and position the
    cursor where you want the text to be placed, and press [Alt P].

Quote [Alt Q]

    [Alt Q] functions much the same as [Alt P]. [Alt Q] is designed for
    quoting text into BBS message areas. This function allows you to
    prepare messages with quotations in the Edit window. Quoting text is
    exactly like pasting except that every line is preceded by the quote
    prefix. The text is reformatted to line up with the quote margin.

Write [Alt A]

    The Write function allows you to write or append the marked text to a
    file.

New [Alt N]

    Pressing [Alt N] starts a new edit file. If the file in the editor has
    been edited, you will be asked if you want to save the file first.

Saving Files [F2]

    [F2] brings up the File dialog and you can type in the name of the
    file you want to save to.

Loading Files [F3]

    Loading files is very similar to saving a file. The [F3] key loads a
    file to the Edit window.

Find [F4]

    When you select this function, you see the "Find: _" prompt. Type in
    the text you wish to find or press [Up] to recall the last search
    string. This function is not case sensitive. For example, "big" finds
    "BIG" or "BiG", etc.

Next [F5]

    Pressing [F5] finds/replaces the next occurrence of the find text.

Replace [F6]

    When you select this option you are prompted with the "Find: _"
    prompt. After typing in the text to find, you see "Replace with: _".
    Type in the text that should replace any text that is found. When a
    match is found, you are asked "Replace [Yes,No,Replace All,Quit] ? _".
    Press 'Y' to confirm the replacement, 'N' to ignore, 'Q' to abort or
    'R' to repeat the replacement until no more text is found or [Esc] is
    pressed.

Goto [F7]

    Invoking the Goto command causes "Goto #" to appear in the upper left
    corner of the View window. Type in the line number you wish to go to.

Filter [F8]

    Some word processors, such as WordStar, use the 8th bit for special
    purposes. You can filter out the 8th bit by pressing [F8]. The 8th bit
    is hidden but not removed.

Reformat [F9]

    To reformat a paragraph, move the cursor to the beginning of the
    paragraph and press [F9]. You can change the right margin setting
    through the Options/General dialog. By holding down the [F9] key,
    Telemate continues to reformat until it is released.

Auto Indent

    If this option is on, when [Enter] is pressed, the cursor will be
    placed at the first non-blank position of the previous line. This
    option is useful when you are using the editor for programming. If
    Auto Indent is off, the cursor will be moved to the beginning of each
    line.

Backup Source

    If this option is on, a backup copy with the extension .BAK will be
    produced when an edited file is saved.

Macro Keys

    The editor recognizes the following keys as macro keys.

       Function key:      [F11]  ,        [F12]
       Alt key:      [Alt   F1]  -  [Alt   F12]
       Shift key:    [Shift F1]  -  [Shift F12]
       Ctrl key:     [Ctrl  F1]  -  [Ctrl  F12]
       Alt Number:   [Alt    1]  -  [Alt     0]

    If the macro symbol '^M' is included in these keys, it will be
    translated to a carriage return. Other macro symbol are not
    translated.

    When the View item is selected from the menu bar, the File dialog will
    appear. Select the file you want to view.

    Moving around in the View window is the same as in the Edit window.
    However, Wordstar conventions are not accepted. Instead, characters
    typed in the View window are forwarded to the Terminal window. This
    gives you the ability to issue a command to the remote system without
    leaving the View window.

    Effective telecommunications require constant access to information.
    At certain points in your communications session, you may need access
    to information that previously passed through your screen. You can
    recall this information using the Back (scroll) window. You can open
    this window by pressing [Alt B], [Center] (the FIVE key in the
    keypad), [Ctrl Up] or by clicking the mouse button on the Back item in
    the menu bar.

    The optional [Center] or [Ctrl Up] keys, combined with the [Scroll
    Lock] key, provide a convenient way of accessing the back scroll
    buffer. When the Back window is already on the screen, pressing
    [Center] again or [Ctrl Down] hides the window as if [Esc] were
    pressed.

    Characters typed in the Back window are forwarded to the Terminal
    window as if they were typed in the Terminal window. This allows you
    to operate in both windows at the same time.

    The number of lines that the back scroll buffer can contain is
    controlled by the setting in the Options/General dialog.

Write [Alt A]

    There are two ways to record a communications session. One way is to
    open a log file at the beginning of a session which records the entire
    session. The second way is to use the Write function in the Back
    window. When you see information that you want to keep, simply mark it
    and write (append) it to a file.

Quote [Alt Q]

    [Alt Q] is designed for  quoting text into BBS  message areas. While
    you are in the Back window, you can place the cursor at the message
    you are replying to and press [F10] to start marking. Then you can
    move the cursor to the end of the message and hit [Alt Q]. The marked
    text is sent to the remote system with the quote prefix leading each
    line. If a line is longer than the quote margin, it will be
    reformatted to line up at the quote margin.

Scroll Lock [Scroll Lock]

    When the Back window receives information, the window's cursor will
    normally move to the location of the most recently received text. To
    keep the cursor locked at a particular position, press the [Scroll
    Lock] key.

    The [Scroll Lock] key can be pressed at any time to toggle this
    option. The 'SLK' indicator will be displayed on the status line if
    this option is enabled.

    Note: Turning on or off the LED light on the keyboard may cause data
    overrun in some computers. Telemate controls the state of the LED and
    switches only if the COM port is idle for a certain time. As a result,
    the LED may not reflect the current status. You should check the 'SLK'
    item on the status line instead.

Capture [Ins]

    If this option is on, the incoming data is put into the back scroll
    buffer. As Telemate stores the back scroll buffer to disk, it may
    affect performance on a floppy disk system. In this case, turn the
    Capture function off or set a smaller value to the Back Scroll Limit
    in the Options/General dialog.

Clear [Alt N]

    This function clears the back scroll buffer.

TELEMATE                                            THE MACRO WINDOW    51

    Telemate lets you assign text to a single keystroke so that the text
    is sent to the remote system when the macro key is pressed. This is
    called a keyboard macro. When macros are used properly, they can save
    you from typing many unnecessary keystrokes.

    Pressing [Alt M] the first time brings up the Macro window. Pressing
    [Alt M] twice displays the Macro menu.

    Telemate keeps four key definition tables in memory at all times, the
    macro table, keypad table, the alt-keypad table and the keyboard
    table.

The Macro Table

    The macro table contains all of the function keys and the shifted
    function keys. For example, [F2], [Ctrl F2], [Shift F2] and [Alt F2].

    When a terminal is selected, the corresponding macro table is loaded.
    For example, if the VT102 terminal is selected, the VT102.MAC macro
    table is loaded.

    By default, the [F1] key is the help key, but you can redefine it to
    suit your needs.

The Keypad Table

    The keypad table contains key assignments for terminal emulations.
    Each terminal type has its own keypad definition file. When a new
    terminal is selected, the corresponding keypad table is loaded. The
    keypad keys that can be defined include the following keys:

     [BackSpace]                                         [Grey /]
                  [Home]  [Up]    [PgUp]   [Ctrl PgUp]   [Grey *]
     [Ctrl Left]  [Left] [Center] [Right]  [Ctrl Right]  [Grey -]
                  [End]  [Down]   [PgDn]   [Ctrl PgDn]   [Grey +]
                  [Ins]           [Del]                  [Enter]

    By default, the [PgUp] key is the upload key and the [PgDn] key is the
    download key, but you can redefine them to suit your needs. The
    [Center] key brings up the Back window unless you redefine it.

The Alt-Keypad Table

    The 101-keyboard has an extra set of cursor keys. They are known as
    the alternate keypad. To define these keys you must turn on the
    Enhanced Keyboard option under the Options/Mouse & Keyboard dialog.

The Keyboard Table

    This is sometimes called the translation table because it changes the
    incoming or outgoing characters to another value. For each character
    in the ASCII set, the table defines what it should be changed to. This
    table allows you to completely redefine your keyboard.


The Macro Window

    The Macro window displays the first four characters of the macro
    definition. These macros are designed so that they can be accessed by
    pointing with the mouse and clicking. They can also be invoked by
    pressing the indicated key(s).

Macro Symbols

    In addition to accepting standard alphanumeric text, Telemate also
    uses certain symbols which when passed through the phone lines perform
    specific functions. For example, the character "^M" in a macro
    translates to [Enter] on the other end. Below is a table of symbols
    you can include in your macros:

The '^-' Keystroke Simulation Macro Symbol

    This macro symbol simulates keystrokes as if they are generated by the
    keyboard, including [Alt] keys. It must appear at the beginning of the
    macro. The syntax is:

       '^-' [keystroke] [keystroke] [...]

    The following rules apply to [keystroke]:

    1. Normal character: For normal characters, there is no special prefix
    character. For example, "^-abc" generates the characters "abc".

    2. Control character: For control characters from [Ctrl A] (ASCII 1)
    to [Ctrl Z] (ASCII 26) and [Esc] (ASCII 27), the '^' character is used
    as the prefix character. For example, "^-Robinson^M^[" generates the
    word "Robinson" followed by an [Enter] and then an [Esc].

    Note: in the Terminal window, "^H" is not the same as the [BackSpace]
    key, "^H" generates the character ASCII 8. [BackSpace] generates the
    string defined in the keypad table.


TELEMATE                                            THE MACRO WINDOW    55


    3. The ^ character itself: Two consecutive '^' generates one '^'
    character. For example, "^-^^" generates a '^'.

    4. [Alt] and function key: An [Alt] or function key is represented by
    an accent '`' followed by the keyboard scan code in 4 hexadecimal
    characters. The keyboard scan code list is shown in the appendix.

    5. The accent ` character itself: Two consecutive accent ` generates
    one accent ` character. For example, "^-``" generates a `.

    Caution: An accent character is a <`>, not a <'>.

    For example, the macro sequence "^-`1200`2e00`1400`1900" generates
    [Alt E] [Alt C] [Alt T] [Alt P] which switches to the editor, copies
    the marked text to the clipboard, switches to the terminal and pastes
    the contents of the clipboard to the remote system.

    There are certain limitations on the other macro symbols that you can
    use. The macro symbols that are supported are '^A' - '^Z', '^[' and
    '^^'. All other symbols are interpreted as if they are typed from the
    keyboard. For example, '^~' generates '^~', '~' generates '~' (not
    pause 0.5 second) and '^#' generates '^#' instead of dropping DTR. For
    example, the sequence "^-^@^~~^#^%^$^&^*^(^)^-^=^\" generates exactly
    "^@^~~^#^%^$^&^*^(^)^-^=^\".

    If you want a special macro symbol to work, you have to put it in
    another function key and generate the scan code for that function key.
    The '^-' macro symbol can nest function keys. For example, suppose the
    [F3] key is defined as "^&^M" which sends the password and then a
    carriage return. You can define "^-Robinson^M`3d00^[^[^[" which send
    the word "Robinson", an [Enter], an [F3] key and then three [Esc]
    keys.

    Note: You should avoid using the [Shift Fn] key to simulate the Copy
    [Alt C], Cut [Alt U] and Tag [Alt G] keys because it will result in
    [Shift Alt C], [Shift Alt U] and [Shift Alt G] respectively and the
    clipboard is not cleared before adding new data. On the other hand,
    you must use the [Shift Fn] key to produce the keys [Shift Alt C],
    [Shift Alt U] and [Shift Alt G].

The '^=' Hot Key Macro Symbol

    With the hot key macro symbol, you can define DOS commands or external
    protocols for all of the function keys. This macro symbol must appear
    at the beginning of the macro. The syntax is:

       '^=' [command] ['^='] ['^M'] ['^[']

    [command] can be a DOS command, external editor, external protocol, a
    batch file or whatever is required.

    ['^='] is optional. If specified, it will be converted to baud rate
    and COM port information in the same order as those parameters passed
    to an external protocol.

    ['^M'] is optional. If specified, it forces the command to execute
    immediately. Otherwise, the command line dialog [Alt R] will prompt
    you for more information.

    ['^['] is optional. If specified after the ^M above, the DOS window
    will be hidden after the command is executed. This symbol has no
    effect on commands used with the /P (pause) option.

The '^\' Run Script Macro Symbol

    With this macro symbol, a script file can be started by pressing one
    function key. For example, if you define [F10] as "^\HOST", then the
    file HOST.SCR in the script directory will be run by pressing [F10].
    This macro symbol must appear at the beginning of the macro.

Redefining the Keyboard

    Sometimes it is necessary for certain incoming or outgoing characters
    to be changed to another value or stripped altogether. For this
    purpose, Telemate provides an incoming and an outgoing character
    'keyboard table'. For each character in the ASCII set, the table
    defines what the character should be changed to. By default, no
    character translation is performed.

    Suppose that both incoming and outgoing translations are enabled and
    the following translation is required:

       Original  In     Out
      ÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕÕ
        65:A Ø  65:B Ø  65:C

    When the character 'A' is received from the remote system, the
    character 'B' is displayed on the screen. When the character 'A' is
    typed from the keyboard, the character 'C' is sent to the remote
    system.


Loading and Saving Macros, Keypads and Keyboards

    Although you can only have a limited number of macros active at any
    one time, Telemate gives you access to an unlimited number of macros.
    You can store one set of macros in one file and have a completely
    different set in a different macro file. These files can be saved and
    loaded whenever you need them using the Macro menu.

    Once you have defined some macros, you must save them. To do this,
    access the Macro menu, then highlight the "Save Macro" option and
    press [Enter]. Telemate uses the default extension .MAC for macro,
    .PAD for keypad and .KEY for keyboard files.

    To load a macro, keypad or keyboard file, select the appropriate
    option from the Macro menu. The File dialog opens and displays the
    files with the corresponding extension (.MAC, .PAD, or .KEY). You can
    then select the file you want to load.

Protocol Dialog: allows you to select the ASCII, Kermit and Zmodem options
    and other general protocol features.

External Protocol Dialog: allows you to set up the external protocols.

    NOTE: Most of Telemate's default settings should be sufficient. On the
    other hand, don't be afraid to experiment with some of the items.


Saving and Loading Options

    When you select the Save or Load menu item, Telemate displays the File
    dialog. By default, files which have the extension .CFG are shown.


Saving Windows

    When you select this function, the position of all windows will be
    saved to the configuration file.

Swap Telemate To EMS/XMS: When this option is on, Telemate will swap
    itself to XMS or EMS while jumping to DOS and, therefore, leaves the
    most memory for the DOS shell. If both XMS and EMS memory are present,
    Telemate will swap to XMS if there is enough memory. If the swap is
    not successful, Telemate will swap to EMS memory.

Swap Telemate To Disk: Similar to the "Swap Telemate To EMS/XMS", Telemate
    will swap itself to a disk file named TM.SWP in the virtual memory
    directory while jumping to DOS if this option is on. If both the
    'Swap' options are on, Telemate will swap to XMS/EMS when there is
    enough memory. If the swap is not successful, Telemate will swap to
    disk.

Maximum Dos Shell: This option must be used with the 'Swap' options above.
    When it is turned on, Telemate occupies only 5K bytes in the main
    memory so that you have the maximum DOS shell possible to run other
    applications. One problem with this is that Telemate will disable the
    COM port and incoming data will be lost since the routine to handle
    the transmission is no longer in memory. If RTS/CTS flow control is
    used, Telemate will lower the RTS signal to prevent data loss. If this
    option is off, Telemate will only swap part of itself out to allow for
    continued transmission until the buffer is full.


TELEMATE                                           THE OPTION DIALOG    62


Scroll Bars: If this option is on, the top window displays scroll bars for
    mouse use. For a detailed description of scroll bars and mouse
    operations, refer to the section "IF YOU HAVE A MOUSE".

Menu Bar: If this option is on, a menu bar is shown on the top line of the
    screen. If you have a mouse, you can click on an item in the menu bar
    to access the corresponding window or menu.

Status Line: If this option is on, a status line is shown on the bottom of
    the screen. The status line provides immediate information on terminal
    emulation, baud rate, parity, data bits, stop bits, COM port, script
    file, log file, printer status and the current remote system.

    Note: Pressing [Alt -] toggles the status line and the menu bar. On
    some foreign keyboards, [Alt +] is the equivalent key.

24 Hour Format: If this option is on, time is displayed in 24-hour format.
    Otherwise, it is displayed in 12-hour format.

Date Format: Telemate supports 9 date formats which can be divided into 3
    groups. The first group uses '-' as the separator, the second uses the
    '/' and the third '.'. The codes are as follows:
      0: MM-DD-YY    1: DD-MM-YY     2: YY-MM-DD
      3: MM/DD/YY    4: DD/MM/YY     5: YY/MM/DD
      6: MM.DD.YY    7: DD.MM.YY     8: YY.MM.DD
    Note: This date format does not affect the date format used in the
    script language.

Scroll Back Limit: This is the number of lines the scroll back buffer can
    contain. Setting the limit to 0 will disable the scroll back function
    and minimizes the size of the virtual memory file. On a floppy disk
    system, this value should be 100 or less to reduce disk access and
    speed up the display.

Editor Margin: This is the right margin of the editor. The words you type
    beyond this margin are wrapped to the next line. The margin also
    bounds the right side during reformatting.

Message Pause: This is the amount of time, in seconds, that the Message
    Box appears when displayed.

Error Pause: This is the amount of time, in seconds, that the Error Box
    appears when an error is encountered.

Screen Saver: This is the amount of time, in minutes, that Telemate will
    wait for keyboard or mouse input before activating the screen saver. A
    message is displayed in random locations on the screen when the screen
    saver is active. A zero in this field will disable the screen saver
    feature. Pressing the [Alt `] key activates the screen saver
    immediately. On some foreign keyboards, [Alt `] is equivalent to
    pressing [Alt] together with the key left of the [1] key.  Note: The
    [Alt `] key is only available if the Enhanced Keyboard option is
    turned ON under the Options/Mouse & Keyboard dialog.

Log Filter: If this option is on, all of the control codes are filtered
    out while the communication session is recorded.

Log Heading: If this option is on, a brief message is inserted into the
    log file which indicates the date and time the log is opened.

Usage Log: If this option is on, actions such as connecting to a remote
    system, upload/download status, and online/offline status, are
    recorded in the TM.USE file.

Music: Some BBS's send ANSI music instructions via phone line. If this
    options is turned on, Telemate interprets those instructions and plays
    the music.

Bell: The ASCII code 7 is the bell code. To keep Telemate silent, turn off
    this option.

External Alarm: If turned on, the batch file TMALARM.BAT will be executed
    as an external alarm under the following conditions:
       1. Both Alarm Sound and Alarm Time are greater than 0.
       2. You are in the Terminal, Dial or Stack windows.
    Five parameters are passed to the batch file as %1, %2, %3, %4 and %5.
    They are
          %1 = Alarm Type
               = 0 if Transfer success
               = 1 if Transfer failure
               = 2 if Connected to a BBS
               = 3 if Script alarm
               = 4 if Warning (e.g. not enough disk space)
          %2 = Alarm Sound (no. of seconds the alarm should sound)
          %3 = Alarm Time  (no. of seconds the alarm should display)
          %4 = BBS # connected to
          %5 = Current baud rate (300 to 115200)

Alarm Sound: This is the amount of time, in seconds, that the alarm song

Mouse Type: Telemate supports Microsoft and MouseSystem mice. Almost every
    mouse emulates one of these two, and many emulate both.

Mouse Port: This refers to the serial port your mouse is connected to.
    This option only applies to MouseSystem mouse. If your mouse is a
    Microsoft mouse, there is no need to select a port. Due to the PC's
    architecture, you cannot have a mouse on COM1 and a modem on COM3, or
    a mouse on COM2 and a modem on COM4. But you can put a mouse on COM1
    and a modem on COM2, or a mouse on COM2 and a modem on COM3, etc.

Mouse Speed: If the mouse pointer seems to move too slow or too fast, you
    can adjust the speed with this option. This option only applies to
    MouseSystem mouse. If your mouse is a Microsoft mouse, you should use
    the mouse driver to adjust the speed.

Swap Left/Right Buttons: If this option is on, the function of the left
    and right buttons is exchanged.

Enhanced Keyboard: If this option is off, the alternate keypad of the 101-
    keyboard is used as the normal keypad. If this option is on, the
    alternate keypad uses the separate definition. You should turn on this
    option only if you have an AT BIOS. The XT BIOS does not support the
    enhanced keyboard function call.

Dial Prefix: Dial prefix is the string to be sent before the phone number.
    Normally, a pulse phone uses the prefix "ATDP" and a touch-tone phone
    uses "ATDT". Note that there is a pointer in the Phone Entry dialog
    pointing to one of the prefixes.

Dial Suffix: The dial suffix is the string to be sent after the phone
    number. Usually it is simply a carriage return. But some phone
    companies offer a phone card which requires that the phone card number
    follow the phone number. This number should be put in the suffix. Note
    that there is a pointer in the Phone Entry dialog pointing to one of
    the suffixes.

Connect Strings: These are the strings which the modem sends upon getting
    a connection, (e.g. "CONNECT"). There is no need to define different
    strings for different baud rates. The extra connect strings are
    intended for connection with some communication services.

Busy Strings: These are the four strings which the modem sends when it has
    failed to make a connection while dialing (e.g. "NO CARRIER").

Break String: When this string is received while dialing, the redial cycle
    is broken. For example, if someone calls you when you are dialing out,
    the modem reports RING and the redial cycle is broken.

Cancel String: This is the string Telemate should send to the modem to
    cancel the dialing attempt, for example, the carriage return "^M".

Dial Time: This is the number of seconds that Telemate should wait for a
    connection while dialing.

Redial Pause: This is the number of seconds that Telemate should wait
    between attempts while dialing.

Redial Attempt: This is the number of times that Telemate should perform
    the dialing procedure. Setting this number to 0 will allow the redial
    attempts to go on until aborted manually or until a connection.

Auto Baud Detect: If this option is turned on, Telemate checks the modem
    connect string for a baud rate indication and switches to the new baud
    rate. This options only works with Hayes compatible modems.

Auto Redial: If this option is turned on, Telemate will automatically
    redial the current dial list upon carrier drop. To use this function,
    the carrier signal must reflect the actual online status.

Multiple Line: If this option is on and a connection is made, the board
    names identical to or similar to the one just connected are removed
    from the dial list. Similar board names are compared by checking all
    but the last 5 characters. In addition, the board names must be longer
    than 10 characters.

    DOS's ability to make and use subdirectories provides an effective way
    to manage your files. Below are suggested subdirectories and the files
    which should be placed in those directories.

    Telemate allows you to define multiple upload directories by adding
    ';' between the directories. If a file is not found in the first
    directory, Telemate will search the second and so on. If the file name
    contains wildcard characters, the search will stop when a match is
    found. For example, specifying *.* will only upload all the files in
    C:\TM\UL\ in the example above.

    Multiple download directories can also be defined by adding ';'
    between the directories with the wildcard between '(' and ')'. You can
    specify multiple wildcards for the same directory by adding ','
    between the wildcards. In the example above, *.QW? files are put into
    the \QWK\ directory, *.GIF and *.PCX are put into the \PIC\ directory,
    and all other files are put into the C:\TM\DL\ directory.

    There should be at least 128K free in the virtual memory directory and
    at least 256K free if you have the "Swap Telemate to Disk" option
    turned on. You need to have at least 512K available if you have the
    "Maximum DOS shell" option turned on.

Terminal: Telemate gives you the choice of six terminal types: ANSI,
    Avatar, Prism, TTY, VT102 and VT52. When a terminal type is selected,
    the corresponding macro file (.MAC) and keypad file (.PAD) is loaded.
    For example, VT102.MAC and VT102.PAD is loaded when VT102 is selected.

Connection: Normally, the connection should be Modem. Since Telemate
    determines online and offline status by inspecting the carrier signal
    of the modem, you should not force the carrier signal to always high
    or always low. If the COM port is linked to a host computer directly
    via a cable or a null modem, you should select Computer, and Telemate
    will not check the carrier signal. A connection is assumed and the
    phone number will not be dialed. You can also select BIOS or FOSSIL
    driver. BIOS only supports up to 9600 baud but you may experience data
    loss at 2400 or higher. BIOS connection does not support RTS/CTS flow
    control. If you have an Enhanced BIOS, the BIOS connection supports up
    to 38400 baud. FOSSIL driver supports up to 38400 baud. If the baud
    rate is over the limit, Telemate will automatically switch to Modem
    connection.

XON/XOFF flow control: When this option is on, XOFF [Ctrl S] causes the
    terminal to stop transmitting characters until a XON [Ctrl Q] is
    received.


TELEMATE                                           THE OPTION DIALOG    70


RTS/CTS flow control: High speed modems use hardware handshaking to
    control the flow of data. If your modem supports hardware flow
    control, this option should be on. BIOS connection does not support
    RTS/CTS flow control.

File Tag Separator: The tag feature allows you to select the file names in
    the marked text and put them into the clipboard. The file names are
    separated by the tag separator which can be a space, a carriage return
    or a comma depending on the remote system you are using.

Initial Guessing: If this option is turned on, Telemate scans the incoming
    data and looks for 'From:' or 'Name:' and remembers the initials of
    the name that follows. If there is any chance of an incorrect guess,
    the guessing initial will be cleared.

Quote Prefix: This is the string to be sent before each quoted line. If
    the character '@' is in the string, it is replaced by the guessing
    initial if the Initial Guessing feature is enabled. Otherwise, it is
    ignored.

Quote Margin: This field defines the right margin which the quote function
    will use to reformat the quoted text.

Add Line Feed: Some BBS's do not add a line feed at the end of each line
    of data. In this situation, you should turn this option on to add line
    feeds.

Add Return: If this option is on, a carriage return [Ctrl M] is supplied
    after a line feed is received.

Auto Wrap: If this option is on and a character reaches column 80, the
    cursor is wrapped to a new line. Otherwise, the cursor stays at column
    80.

Confirm Hang Up: If this option is on and the hangup command [Alt H] is
    issued, you will be asked for confirmation.

Destructive Backspace: If this option is on, backspace [Ctrl H] will
    destroy the character on the left. Otherwise, backspace only moves the
    cursor to the left.

Local Echo: If the remote system does not send the characters you typed
    back, you should turn this on and the characters you type are echoed
    to the terminal automatically.

Strip High Bit: If this option is on, the 8th bit of the incoming data
    will be filtered out. This option is very useful when the actual link
    is 7E1 but you use 8N1 as COM parameter.

Modem Init String: This string is sent to the modem when Telemate starts
    in or switches to the originate mode. The '^(' macro symbol is
    attached to this string.

Modem HangUp String: This string is sent to the modem to hang up the
    phone. The '^*' macro symbol refers to this string. The '^#' macro
    symbol should be included in this string so that it will drop DTR to
    hangup.

Auto Answer String: This string is sent to the modem when Telemate
    switches to Answer mode. The '^)' macro symbol refers to this string.

Answer Back string: This string is sent to the remote system when the
    ASCII code ENQ is received. However, this string will not be sent if
    CIS Quick B transfers are selected because ENQ is used as part of that
    protocol.

Baud Rate: This is the speed at which communications take place. Check
    your modem manual if you are not sure what speeds are supported.

Parity: Parity is a form of error checking. You can choose between None,
    Even, Odd, Mark and Space. The majority of BBS's are set up for No
    parity.

Data Bits and Stop Bits: Data bits refers to how many bits of data are
    sent before a stop bit is sent. Most BBS's use 8 data bits and 1 stop
    bit.

Filename Guessing: Some protocols, such as Xmodem, require you to supply a
    download file name. If this option is on, Telemate guesses the
    possible file name based on the incoming text and puts it in the file
    selection box.

Check Disk Space: If this option is on, a warning message is displayed
    when the size of the file to be downloaded is larger than the amount
    of free disk space. If this message appears, use the MOVE function in
    the DOS command window [Alt R] to make room for the downloaded file.

Zmodem Recovery: When this is on, Zmodem resumes an aborted transfer at a
    later time. A date check is performed to ensure it is an interrupted
    transfer. If the date check fail, the newly received file will be
    renamed instead of resumed.

Zmodem Auto-Download: If this option is on, Telemate automatically takes
    over the file reception without any user interaction.


TELEMATE                                           THE OPTION DIALOG    73


Zmodem ASCII-Upload: If this option is on, Telemate sends the remote
    system a signal to indicate that the file is an ASCII file and
    requires end-of-line conversion. Caution: This option should be turned
    off unless the remote system requests it to be turned on. Otherwise,
    the upload will not be successful.

Kermit Options: Please refer to the document of the host computer for the
    details of this option.

Expand Blank Line: If this is on and a blank line is received, Telemate
    adds a space to that line. This option is used during ASCII transfers
    with pasting or quoting. This is very useful for systems that assume a
    blank line means "end of message" when pasting a message to most
    bulletin boards.

Line/Character Pacing: When pasting or quoting to the remote system during
    ASCII transfers, it may be necessary to wait between each character or
    each line. Line pace is the amount of time, in 1/20 seconds, that
    Telemate should wait after sending each line. Character pace is the
    amount of time that Telemate should wait between each character.

Pace Character: During an ASCII upload or when pasting marked text, some
    remote systems send a special character, such as ASCII 13, when they
    are ready to receive the next line. This character is called a pace
    character. If this value is 0, Telemate uploads/pastes without waiting
    for a pace character.

Extended Pacing: Similar to character pacing, an extended pace is the time
    delay, in 1/20 seconds, that Telemate should wait between each
    character in a macro or in a string PUT by a script file.

ASCII Upload/Download: A number of options are available for ASCII
    transfers. If 'Strip High Bit' is on, the 8th bit will be stripped. If
    'Translation' is on, the keyboard table will be used to translate the
    incoming or outgoing characters. If 'Strip CR' is on, the carriage
    return character is rejected. If 'Strip LF' is on, the line feed
    character is rejected. If 'Add CR before LF' is on, the carriage
    return character is inserted before the line feed character. If 'Add
    LF after CR' is on, the line feed character is inserted after the
    carriage return character.

Auto-Download Sequence: New external protocols have the ability to start
    the download automatically by detecting a specific data sequence.
    Telemate scans the incoming data for the auto-download sequence and
    executes the corresponding external protocol. This feature is disabled
    if 'Prompt Download Name' option is ON or the Terminal window, Command
    Stack window or the Chat window is not the top window. The carriage
    return '^M' and line feed '^J' character must not present in the
    sequence. The following are protocols that support this feature and
    their auto-download sequence.

    On the 101-key keyboard, there is an extra set of cursor keys. These
    are pre-defined to emulate the associated functions.


TELEMATE       APPENDIX B: KEYBOARD ASSIGNMENT IN TERMINAL EMULATION    78


    The 84-key keyboard does not have the extra cursor keys. As a result,
    the [F5] - [F8] keys are used to emulate the arrow keys and [F10] is
    used to emulate the [Del] key.

    By default, the [BackSpace] key is defined as ASCII 8 [Ctrl H]. Some
    terminals require the [BackSpace] to be defined as ASCII 127. You can
    redefine the [BackSpace] key under the Macro/Keypad dialog. Or you can
    copy the keypad file VT102DEL.PAD to VT102.PAD.


TELEMATE                         APPENDIX C: FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS    79


APPENDIX C: FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS
ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ

Xmodem: This was once the most popular protocol in use, but it is being
    replaced by quicker and more reliable protocols. Error checking is
    done with checksum or Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC).

Xmodem-1K: This is a variation of Xmodem which uses blocks that may be 128
    bytes or 1024 bytes in size. Some BBS software refers to Xmodem-1K as
    Ymodem. Ymodem sends the name, size and date of the file but Xmodem-1K
    does not. If the file name 'UNKNOWN.$$$' shows in the File Transfer
    window during a Ymodem transfer, it is likely that the BBS software is
    using Xmodem-1K. In this case, you should select Telemate's Xmodem-1K
    protocol.

Relaxed Xmodem: This is the same as Xmodem except that it has a longer
    delay time. This is for use with remote services that can not tolerate
    strict timing during Xmodem transfers.

Ymodem: This is an Xmodem variation which uses blocks that may be 128
    bytes or 1024 bytes in size and maintains the correct name, size, and
    date.

Batch Ymodem: This protocol is a variation on Ymodem, which allows several
    files to be sent during each transfer. Also refer as True Ymodem.

Ymodem-G: This protocol is a variation on Batch Ymodem. It achieves very
    high transfer rates by sending blocks one after another without
    waiting for acknowledgement. However, this requires an error-free link
    such as an error-correcting modem or null modem cable between two
    computers. If an error is detected by the receiver, the transfer is
    aborted. Ymodem-G supports the transfer of multiple files.

Zmodem: This advanced protocol is both fast and reliable, and offers many
    features. Zmodem can transfer a group of files in one batch, while
    keeping the exact file size and dates. Zmodem detects and recovers
    from errors quickly. Zmodem Recovery can resume an aborted transfer.
    And it has the ability to skip the receiving file.

Telink: It is basically the Xmodem protocol using CRC checking. A header
    block is sent before the file indicating its name, size, and date.
    This protocol supports the transfer of multiple files.

SEAlink: SEAlink is an advanced version of Xmodem developed by System
    Enhancement Associates. It is a sliding window protocol. SEAlink
    passes a name, size, and the date of the transferred file and allows
    multiple files to be sent.


TELEMATE                         APPENDIX C: FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS    80


Modem7: This format is similar to Xmodem. It passes the file name before
    starting the transfer and is common on CP/M systems. This protocol
    allows more than one file to be sent at a time.

Kermit: This protocol is designed to permit computers of different types
    to send files to each other. Almost any computer using Kermit can be
    set up to send files to another computer using Kermit.

CIS Quick B: This protocol is used only on the CompuServe Information
    Service (CIS). It is particularly suited for the networks used in
    accessing CIS, which have large turnaround delays. Both sending and
    receiving in a CIS Quick B transfer are totally controlled by
    Compuserve. Therefore, you should select this protocol before telling
    CIS what files to transfer. To assure this, setup the phone entry for
    CIS so that each time it is connected to CIS, the protocol will be
    used as the default. If you select this protocol in the transfer menu,
    Telemate displays the message "CIS Quick B ready" and monitors the
    incoming data for the auto-transfer sequence. If you want to use this
    protocol, you should connect to CIS using the 8N1 COM parameter and
    have the "Strip High Bit" option turned on.

ASCII: This protocol acts as if the sender is typing the characters and
    the receiver is recording them. No error detection is provided with
    this protocol. Although you can use this protocol to upload a message,
    it is suggested that you use the Paste [Alt P] command to send the
    prepared message.

    Telemate allows users to define as many as 8 external protocols using
    DOS batch files. Some external protocol drivers require a large amount
    of memory, so you should turn on the 'Swap Telemate to XMS/EMS', 'Swap
    Telemate to disk' and 'Maximum DOS Shell' options.

    When the external protocol is selected, Telemate executes the batch
    file and passes 3 or more parameters to it. Sometimes the third
    parameter is blank.

           Parameter       Description
           ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ       ƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒƒ
              %1           the baud rate
              %2           the com port number (1 - 8)
              %3           the first file to transfer
              %4           the second file to transfer
              ..           ...

    The batch file should call a driver program for the protocol, using
    the supplied parameters. For example, the batch file for an upload may
    contain the command:

         GIFLINK -b%1 -p%2 sz %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9

    NOTE: You can find various protocol drivers in many public BBS's.

    As you use Telemate on a daily basis, Telemate keeps a record of your
    communications activities. This record is stored in a file called
    TM.USE. Below is an excerpt from a TM.USE file. This file is divided
    into three parts:

    Note: The text shown in brackets [ ] are explanatory notes and are not
    actually from the TM.USE file.

    Telemate comes with a small program called TMSTAT.EXE. TMSTAT.EXE
    takes the information in TM.USE and produces a useful statistical
    report on your usage of Telemate. For details, please refer to
    TMSTAT.DOC.

    The Telemate utility program, TMPHONE.EXE helps you maintain the phone
    directory. It changes the size of the phone directory, inserts
    entries, deletes entries, reorders entries, sorts directories, clears
    the total, zaps connect dates, changes the phone directory size and
    prints the directory. To maintain a phone directory, at the DOS
    command line, type the following:

         TMPHONE [<name of phone directory>]

    and press [Enter]. If no phone directory name is supplied, TM.FON and
    TM.MEM will be used in the maintenance program.

    The phone directory files can be modified with a text editor. However,
    this may cause the system to lost track of the memo field. Therefore,
    you should always use this utility program to maintain the phone
    directory.

    The most common error messages are the following:

Cannot open configuration file

    If the configuration file TM.CFG is not in the current directory,
    Telemate will display this message. If you see this message, you
    should use TMINST.EXE to generate a new configuration file and set the
    DOS environment string 'TMCFG' to the directory containing the new
    TM.CFG. For example, if the Telemate directory is "C:\TM" then the
    following line should be added to the AUTOEXEC.BAT file:

              SET TMCFG=C:\TM\TM.CFG

Problem opening resource file

    If the resource file TM.RES is not in the Telemate directory or the
    resource file is out-dated, Telemate will display this message. If the
    directory is incorrect, you can edit TM.CFG and locate the line
    DirTelemate="" and add the Telemate directory to it. Then make sure
    that the file TM.RES is in the Telemate directory.

Cannot open TM.FON

    The phone directory TM.FON is not in the Telemate directory or has not
    been created. Execute TMINST.EXE and copy TM.FON to the Telemate
    directory if necessary.

Not enough memory to open dialog

    When you encounter this message, you are very low in memory and you
    should exit Telemate immediately and restart Telemate with the '/O' or
    '/N' command line option.

RTS/CTS flow control is turned off because CTS is off

    When Telemate starts, it checks the RTS/CTS option with the hardware.
    If the RTS/CTS option is on but the CTS signal is off, Telemate will
    turn off the RTS/CTS option if the CTS signal is still off after 10
    seconds. Otherwise, no communications can go through the line. This
    message indicates that you may not have your modem turned on or your
    modem/cable does not have a CTS line.

    This error message may appear for one of two reasons.
     . An error is detected in the script file.
     . There is not enough memory to execute TMS.EXE.
    Youshould exit Telemate and compile the script file in DOS command
    line. The script compiler will give you detailed information so that
    you can locate the error in your script file.

    If you are using Windows 3.1 or 3.11, start at step ONE. If you are
    using Windows for Workgroups 3.11, then start at step THREE.

    1) Replace the stock Windows communications driver COMM.DRV (found in
    C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM\) with a 3rd party communications driver such as:

       WFXCOMM.DRV - from Delrina, freeware and available off of most BBS
       CYBERCOM
       KINGCOM
       TURBOCOM

    The last 3 may not be freeware, but provide better performance and
    have more functionality.  Installation of the drivers is quite simple
    and instructions come with the documentation of the driver.

    2) Obtain a copy of CHCOMB.386.  This is also freeware, and is readily
    available on most bbs'.  The purpose of this driver is to allow DOS
    applications to properly utilize your uart's buffering ability.
    Installation is very simple and instructions come with the driver.

    3a) Add the following lines to the [386Enh] section of your Window's
    SYSTEM.INI file (the "X" in each of the follwoing lines stands for the
    com port your modem is dedicated to.  For example, if your modem is on
    Com 2 the the lines should read Com2Buffer=10000 etc.):

       ComxBuffer=10000  ;Windows com buff default is 256 bytes.
       ComBoostTime=4    ;Windows default is 2.

    3b) If you are utilizing WFXCOMM.DRV then add the following lines to
    the [386Enh] section of  your SYSTEM.INI (the "Rx" and "Tx" portions
    of the following two lines does not refer to a com port. For example
    if you modem is on Com 2 then the line would read Com2RxSize=4 etc.):

       ComxRxSize=4  ;Defines the interupt threshold for the receive FIFO.
                     ;Default value is 14, but a lower setting of 4
                     ;increases receive reliability (8 may work well ... I
                     ;recommend 4).

       ComxTxSize=16 ;Defines the number of bytes loaded into the
                     ;transmit FIFO on each interupt.  Default value is
                     ;8, but 16 reduces interupt overhead without
                     ;decreasing reliability.

    3c) Remove any lines that refer to "ComxFifo=" in the SYSTEM.INI. The
    FIFO is enabled by default ... hence this line is redundant.


TELEMATE                  APPENDIX H: RUNNING TELEMATE UNDER WINDOWS    87


    4) If your modem is running on Com4 and you are not utilizing Com3
    then you must disable Com3 while in Windows.  This is accomplished by
    editing your Window's SYSTEM.INI file and altering the following lines
    found under the [386Enh] section:

       Com3Irq=4
       Com3Base=03E8
          to
       Com3Irq=-1
       Com3Base=-1

    If you do not have the above lines in your SYSTEM.INI, then add them
    to the [386Enh] section.  You should also add the following lines in
    the same section stating the address of the Com Port and the IRQ it
    utilizes.

       Com4Irq=3        ;Or whatever FREE irq you choose.
       Com4Base=02E8

    5) Edit your TELEMATE.PIF* file (found in the C:\TM\ directory) and
    change the foreground/background priority settings to EQUAL settings.
    I suggest a setting of 100 for each, although 50 *may* do -- you
    should experiment. If things are not working properly then adjust BOTH
    *up* equally.

    Also, make sure that the PIF (only for TELEMATE) file has the "/W"
    switch under the "Optional Parameters" section.  If you are starting
    TELEMATE through a batch file, then add the /W switch in the batch
    file.

    6) While editing the .PIF, make sure "Background Execution" is enabled
    AND the "Exclusive box" is disabled.

    Next, click on the "Advanced" button, and enable (check) the "Lock
    Application Memory" box.  This prevents application memory swapping.
    For this to work effectively, you must be in 386 Enhanced Mode, have a
    permanent swap file, and 32bit disk access should be enabled (if
    possible).  If you have a CONFIG.SYS setting of 40 Buffers, then
    disable (un-check) the "Uses High Memory Area" box ... you do not have
    any extra HMA for TELEMATE to use.

    Lastly, enter the values "-1" (without the quotes) in both the "KB
    Required" and "KB Desired" boxes under "Memory Requirements." Leave
    the XMS & EMS memory requirement boxes at their default settings. The
    "-1" setting allows TELEMATE the maximum amount of memory it requires
    at any given moment.

    Q: Why should I register ?  Is there any difference between the
       registered version and the non-registered version ?
    A: Telemate is NOT FREE. You MUST register after the 30-day
       evaluation time period. You will receive the latest version and
       a registration number. The registration number will remove the
       ending screen and any annoying functions in the current and all
       future versions.

    Q: What is the best way to run Telemate under Windows?
    A: Refer to Appendix H for detailed information on how to run
       Telemate under Windows.

    Q: Does Telemate support 14400, 16800 or 28800 bps modems? How
       come there is no such setting under the Options/Terminal
       dialog?
    A: Yes, Telemate does support 14400 or 28800 bps modems. The bps
       (bit per second) describes the maximum throughput of the modem.
       However, there is no such setting in the PC hardware. To
       achieve the modem maximum throughput, simply select the higher
       baud rate 19200 or 38400 and turn on the RTS/CTS flow control
       under the Options/Terminal dialog. Also, make sure you have the
       'Auto baud detect' option turned off under the Options/Dial
       setup dialog; otherwise, the screen may display garbage when
       you are connected.

    Q: Even since I upgrade my 2400 modem to a high speed modem, the
       screen receives garbage as soon as it connect, or it connects
       at 2400 baud. How do I correct this?
    A: Turn off the 'Auto baud detect' under the Options/Dial setup
       dialog. Set the baud rate to 19200 or 38400 baud under the
       Options/Terminal dialog. Finally, check each entry in the phone
       directory and set the baud rate to 'Default' so that it will
       use the baud rate you set up in the Options/Terminal dialog.

    Q: How do I change the size of the phone directory?
    A: Run TMPHONE.EXE and select the Change Size item in the menu.
       Then you can increase the size up to 1000 entries.

    Q: How do I sort the phone directory?
    A: Run TMPHONE.EXE and select the Sort Directory item in the menu.


TELEMATE                      APPENDIX I: FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS    89


    Q: My modem does not hang up immediately after I press [Alt H].
       How do I correct this?
    A: You should include the macro "^#", which drop the DTR, in the
       Modem HangUp string. Moreover, you should set the DIP switch in
       the modem such that the terminal can control the DTR. Some
       modems have an AT command to control the DTR signal, it may be
       "AT &D2". Try to add "&D2" to the modem init string.

    Q: Telemate always shows that it is online. How do I correct this?
    A: You should setup the modem such that the carrier signal
       reflects the actual online status. Some modems use a DIP switch
       to control it. Some use an AT command to control it, it may be
       "AT &C1". Try to add "&C1" to the modem init string.

    Q: When connected to a BBS, the Dial window does not go away
       automatically, and the script is not executed. How do I correct
       this?
    A: Check the connect string under the Options/Dial setup dialog.
       There should be a 'CONNECT' in it. Then add a "X4" into the
       the 'Modem Init String' under the Options/Communicatino dialog.
       The "X4" instructs the modem to report 'CONNECT' when it connects
       to BBS. When Telemate detects the 'CONNECT' string, it hides the
       Dial window and executes the script.

What is GIFLink

    GIFLink is an easy to use protocol driver that allows you to view the
    transmitting GIF images in stunning SuperVGA graphics. And it is the
    first protocol driver that uses full screen computer graphics in
    SuperVGA mode.

    GIFLink supports most of the popular file transfer protocols such as
    Zmodem, Batch Ymodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem and CompuServe QuickB. If the
    files being transmitted are not GIF images, GIFLink will work just
    like as a normal protocol driver. So GIFLink will transmitted any
    files, not just GIF images.

    GIFLink also has a special VIEW mode so that you can look at the
    received GIF images in a slideshow format or preview the images you
    are going to sent.


What is GIFLITE

    GIFLITE is a high quality GIF-to-GIF image compression program. It
    compresses the GIF files so that they will require much less disk
    space yet still preserve the same quality and resolution.

TELEMATE                                    APPENDIX K: PRODUCT LINE    92


    With GIFLITE, digitized GIF images can be further compressed by an
    average of 30%. What makes GIFLITE special is that the resulting GIF
    files are almost identical to the original file. Human eyes can hardly
    tell them apart.

    GIFLITE conforms to both GIF87a and GIF89a standards. All non-image
    information is preserved in the resulting GIF files. The compressed
    images can be read by standard GIF decoders, such as VPIC v4+, CSHOW
    v8.3+ and GIFLink.
