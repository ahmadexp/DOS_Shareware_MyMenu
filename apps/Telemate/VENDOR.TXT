Minor Update

Telemate is a full featured communications program with an
easy-to-learn and easy-to-use integrated environment. Its
multithreading feature allows you to prepare messages, view
files while you are downloading and printing files. Each task
run in its own movable and resizable window. The Windows-like
mouse interfaces let you complete a connection and select
options without touching a key.

The back scroll buffer works just like the built-in editor and
viewer and you can save parts of the content to files. Through
the clipboard, you can cut and paste text among windows and
quote message from the back scroll buffer to the remote system.

Telemate has the most popular protocols built-in, including
Zmodem, Ymodem-G, Xmodem, Kermit and CompuServe QuickB, with
batch file transfer status and multiple upload and download
directories. Writing a script program is as simple as writing
a BASIC and PASCAL program. The learn script mode can also
generate script files for you.



Hardware Requirements : IBM PC, PC-compatible or MS-DOS computer
640k RAM, hard drive and modem.

Other Requirements : DOS 3.x or higher.
