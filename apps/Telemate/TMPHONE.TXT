TMPHONE.EXE helps you maintain the phone directory. It allow you to
change the size of the phone directory, insert entries, delete entries,
reorder entries, sort directories, clear the total fields, zap connect
date fields, change the phone directory size and print the directory. To
maintain a phone directory, at the DOS command line, type the following:

     TMPHONE [<name of phone directory>]

and press [Enter]. If no phone directory name is supplied, TM.FON and
TM.MEM will be used in the maintenance program.

The phone directory files can be modified with a text editor. However,
you will cause you to lose track of the memo field. Therefore, you
should always use this utility program to maintain the phone
directory.
