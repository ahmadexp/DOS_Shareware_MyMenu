[ Hacker Style Text reader <-||-> executable maker v1.0.0beta ]
[ FREEWARE! ]

This program compiles a textfile to an executable form. After compilation
the user can execute the newly created file. This provides him with
a hacker style text viewer linked with the textfile to be read.

To create the executable you will need the following files in one directory:
- MAKER.EXE
- ATH_HWR.BIN
- a plain text file

The text file should have the following format for best results:
1 Page = 23 lines
1 line = 80 characters

(Note! Text file should be of reasonable size.)

To create the executable simply type:

MAKER textfile.with_extention output_file_name.exe

e.g.:  MAKER readme.txt runme.exe

If all goes well you should now have an executable file called runme.exe
It is important that you DON'T change its name!!!! To change the filename
you have to recompile.

Have FuN!
