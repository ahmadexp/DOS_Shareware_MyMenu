 INSTALLATION PROBLEMS ?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  When you run INSTALL.EXE, the files 0204TER1._XE and
  0204TER2._XE (and, optionally, other files 0204TER?._XE)
  all need to be in the same directory.

  If you encounter any problems with our low level
  installation routines (music, screen, etc,) then:

  1)   run     INSTALL.EXE /NOINTRO      instead...

  OR

  2)   Try rebooting with a `vanilla flavour'  CONFIG.SYS
       and AUTOEXEC.BAT with no Terminate and Stay Resident
       software (`TSR's) and make sure you specify AT LEAST
       Files=40


  If INSTALL.EXE finished work, but you're having problems
  starting T2.EXE, then try to run T2.EXE with appropriate
  parameters:

         /NOEMS  - to disable use of EMS
  and/or
         /NOXMS  - to disable use of XMS
  and/or
         /FASTCONFIG[=port[,speed]] - to pass through all the
                                      configuration questions
                                      and configure TERMINATOR 2
                                      manually (by setting the
                                      port, bps, etc, etc)

  or, to see the available command-line switches, run:    T.BAT ?


 MEMORY REQUIREMENTS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 TERMINATOR 2 needs at least 550k of conventional (`below 640k')
 free memory to run.
 (2MB extended or expanded memory can be used when you shell out
 and is, therefore, highly recommended but will not remove the
 REQUIREMENT for at least 550k of conventional (`below  640k')
 memory so use another terminal program if you can not achieve
 this minimum figure!)

 To gain conventional free memory, experiment with the /BUF
 command line switch to decrease the amount of memory used by the
 overlay (at the expense of a slight speed penalty. eg:
 T2 /BUF:64
 is the minimum memory needed by TERMINATOR 2'S overlay (100 will
 be a better compromise for many)

 If you load TERMINATOR 2 using the /DBG switch you will be able
 to keep an eye on memory useage...


 MOUSE PROBLEMS ?
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Try toggling PECULIAR MOUSE in CHANGE CONFIGURATION, TOGGLES
 ( [ALT][O], [O], toggle Peculiar mouse on/off )


 PROBLEMS IN MULTITASKING ENVIRONMENTS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Absence of an adequate FIFO Chip (eg: 16550 UART) may cause
 problems with data loss (refer to further technical
 documentation...)

 If you experience Screen corruption or data loss even with an
 adequate FIFO, then try using FOSSIL (such as Ray Gwinn's SIO
 for OS/2 Warp) or increase the VDM session priority.

 Unexpected CARRIER DROP - try to increase session priority or
 try to use a FOSSIL driver instead of direct COM port access.


 DATA LOSS PROBLEMS UNDER DOS
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Problems may also occur when running TERMINATOR 2 on 'slow'
 computers or if the TERMINATOR 2 overlay file is not able to
 load into EMS or XMS.
 These problems relate to TERMINATOR 2's internal 'multitasking'
 kernel and are similar to problems in a multitasking
 environment.

 Our suggestions are:
  1. Do not open windows other than the terminal window before
     and during file transfers
  2. Try to increase the input buffer size in Communication
     setup, Receive Buffer Size:
     [Alt][O], [C], select device, [Enter], [R]
  3. Try to decrease Bps of port:
     [Alt][O], [C], select device, [Enter], [B]


 KEYBOARD
 ~~~~~~~~
 If you are using an 83-keys keyboard, change Enhanced keyboard
 setting in toggles:
 [Alt][O], [O], Enhanced keyboard OFF


 UNRESOLVED PROBLEM(S)
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 If you STILL have problems, check out the comms gurus on your
 local BBS or the various nets.

 But NOT before you have tried a `vanilla flavoured' system:

 1) Create backup and archived copies of your original AUTOEXEC.BAT
    and CONFIG.SYS files

 2) Edit both files to remark out ALL lines that are not ABSOLUTELY
    VITAL to boot your system: especially TSR's and Soundblaster
    drivers and including memory management software such as QEMM.
    (type "rem " at the beginning of each line you wish to render
    temporarily operational)

    Make sure, though, that you have a
    Files=25
    statement (25 is the absolute minimum number of file handles
    needed) and, of course, whatever keyboard driver you need.
    Remove the mouse driver at this point, though.

 3) Reboot your system and TERMINATOR 2 should run OK.

 4) Reinstate each line you previously remarked out until you
    discover the culprit line that causes hiccups anew.


    If the unpack procedure completed normally, and you've tried all
    the advice above, but you STILL have problems, then please run
    REPORT.BAT ? to create a report file for us.

User to user support is available for TERMINATOR 2 in the SHAREWARE
public conferences of FidoNet, ILink and RIME available on many fine
Bulletin Board Systems.

Please be aware that these are all moderated conferences and differing
messaging standards apply - so please read the appropriate guidelines
for the particular conference before posting.

In each and every case, please check that your proposed question has
not *ALREADY* been answered in an older message in the conference or
in \DOCUMENT\FAQ.DOC

I shall make an effort to maintain at least a weekly presence in each
of these conference, but travel and work commitments may mean that
short absences are unavoidable..."
