                             Simply Docs v3.0 
           
           
      Thanks for trying Simply Docs.  I hope you will find Simply Docs
      a very useful program. 
           
      See the file called PACKING.LST for a complete list of all files
      in the Simply Docs package.  To view the users guide, and get an 
      idea of what this program is all about enter the following: 

                     MANUAL        and press RETURN 

      MANUAL.EXE was created with Simply Docs and will let you see  
      some of the program features.  To print out a copy of the manual 
      select choice 2 from the menu.  If your printer cannot print the 
      IBM extended characters choose the ASCII character set from the 
      print options. (enter A)

      Start the compiler to create your own EXE files by entering:

                     SIMDOC        and press RETURN

      From within the compiler you can view the manual by pressing Alt+V
      or print a registration form by pressing Alt+I.
      
      To see whats new in this version you should run the file called
      WHATSNEW.EXE.  Registration details can be found near the end of 
      the manual or in the REGISTER.DOC file.
