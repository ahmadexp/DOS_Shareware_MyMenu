Dear Sysop

Would you like to use Simply Docs to generate files for your BBS?  If
so you may be able to take advantage of this special offer from SimpleWare. 

Sysops provide a valuable service to shareware authors and I would like
your help in promoting my programs.  In return for your help I will 
provide you with a registered copy of Simply Docs for use on your board.

What exactly is required from you?

  1 - Sysop agrees to place any programs received from Simpleware on-line
      in a "preferred" location making it easy for users to download.
      There are currently 3 SimpleWare programs available totaling about 800k.
      These programs are shareware and all meet the ASP standards.

  2 - Sysop agrees to use the descriptions provided by SimpleWare in the
      FILE_ID.DIZ files.

  3 - Sysop agrees to register me as a user on his BBS with a name of
      "Robert Pitcher" and a password of his/her choice.  The password must
      be specified on the form below.  Note: This is for verification only.

By using Simply Docs to create files for your users you provide a valuable
service by exposing Simply Docs to many potential customers.


Who qualifies for this offer?  Any sysop who runs a BBS that meets 
the following requirements.

  1 - Must run a full time BBS and must have been in operation for at
      least six (6) months.

  2 - BBS must be accessable to the general public.  Pay boards are fine.

  3 - BBS must have at least one high speed line (9600 baud min)



What does it cost?  

  To receive your registered copy you must fill out the form at the end 
  of this file and send it along with $5.00 ($10.00 outside Canada and 
  the US) to SimpleWare.  This cost is to cover the disks, postage and
  handling only.

  You will receive a 1.44M 3.5" HD disk containing your registered copy
  of Simply Docs and the latest shareware offered by SimpleWare to be 
  placed on your board.  Sorry, other disk formats are not available in 
  this offer.

  This version of Simply Docs is marked as a "Registered version for Sysop
  use only".


SimpleWare reserves the right to withdraw this offer if it feels a BBS
does not meet the requirements specified above, in which case your money 
will be refunded.  SimpleWare also reserves the right to cancel this 
offer at any time.
