 
                                Cut/Paste 4.0

      The CutPaste utility is a resident (install at bootup) utility.  It is
      quite small, using less than 6K of memory.  With cut/paste anything
      which appears on the screen may be "cut" out and saved for later
      pasting into an application.  

      Installation (execute CUTPAST4):
      --------------------------------
      CutPaste is installed by executing the CUTPAST4.COM file from either
      the command line or the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

      Operation (Alt-F9, edit, END, move, END, Ctrl-F9):
      --------------------------------------------------
      Once installed, CutPaste may be brought up at any time by entering
      Alt-F9.  

      Use the arrow keys to move the cursor to any place on the screen.
      The screen may be edited using the keys detailed below.

      Place the cursor at one corner of the area to be cut out and depress
      the END key.  Notice that the character underneath the cursor turns to
      inverse video.  Now move the cursor to the opposite corner of the area
      to be cut out.  As the cursor is moved the entire area will appear in
      inverse video.

      Depress the END key one more time and the screen returns to normal.
      You are now "out" of CutPaste.  

      To paste the cut area into the application, enter Ctrl-F9.

      The text in the box cut previously will be "typed" into the application,
      as if reentered from the keyboard, starting at the upper left hand 
      corner and proceeding to the lower right hand corner.  If you wish to
      exit CutPaste without cutting anything, reenter the Alt-F9 key.

      CutPaste will add block move capabilities to any word processor (or
      other program) which using BIOS interrupt 16 for keyboard input (that's
      just about everyting except XYWRITE).  CutPaste has been tested with
      many other installables, notably SideKick and the MicroSoft and Mouse
      Systems mouse drivers.  (CutPaste works GREAT with a mouse.)

      CutPaste only works in alphanumeric mode.

      Below is a layout of the keys to which CutPaste assigns editing
      meaning.  Any key which CutPaste does not understand, it merely
      displays as ASCII.  Depressing Alt-F9 enters and exits CutPaste.
