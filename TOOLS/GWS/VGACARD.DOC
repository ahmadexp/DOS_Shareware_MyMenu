
VGA Card Analyzer
€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€€

The VGACARD program will attempt to work out what type of display 
hardware is in your system, such that it can advise you about 
selecting a suitable driver for Alchemy Mindworks' software. It's 
applicable to Graphic Workshop for DOS, Image Gallery and Desktop 
Paint 256.

Note that while VGACARD is usually right, the considerable 
variety of display card types could manage to confuse it. As 
such, its results should be filtered through common sense.

To use VGACARD, type:

        VGACARD

at the DOS prompt. It will tell you whether it finds:

- A standard VGA BIOS... this should be present in all VGA cards.
- A VESA BIOS, and the modes thereof.
- A super VGA card of a type supported by Alchemy Mindworks' 
  software.

It may advise you about the suitability of your display hardware 
for specific applications.

If VGACARD indicates that your card has VESA capabilities, the 
VESA drivers in Alchemy Mindworks' applications should work, even 
if your card type is unrecognized.

If your card does not support VESA and no driver is available for 
it in its native mode, you can probably use a TSR VESA 
interpreter to temporarily provide it with VESA calls. A 
collection of such programs is available by calling the Alchemy 
Mindworks bulletin board at (416) 729-4609. (The area code for 
Alchemy Mindworks' non-800 numbers will change from 416 to 905 
after October 4, 1993.) 

NOTE: If no hardware-specific driver is available for your card 
you can still use it in the standard VGA modes with Graphic 
Workshop and Image Gallery. You cannot use it with Desktop Paint 
256.

There are a number of drivers provided with Graphic Workshop and 
Image Gallery which support cards that VGACARD will not detect, 
primarily drivers written by third parties. If VGACARD says 
there's no driver for your system, look at the section of GWS.DOC 
or GAL.DOC, or at the super VGA driver page of their respective 
installers, to see if your card is supported.
