These games are all distributed as shareware -- if you like them, we request 
that you register them for $15 each.  Your continued support enables us to 
produce more games for everyone.

All games run on the IBM PC family of machines.  CGA or higher graphics 
board required, except where noted.
 
ATC -- An air traffic controller game that's perfect for a few minutes or 
hours of fun.  Easy to learn, but difficult to master.  The game tracks best 
scores at each of 20 levels of difficulty.  (Supports monochrome)
 
BORDER -- a combination of GO and connect the dots, this abstract strategy 
game requires you to enclose more area than your opponent, while preventing 
them from stopping you.

ECOMASTER -- A diverting ecology game in which you buy and sell animals 
based on their abilities to thrive in different environments.  Mildly 
educational without belaboring the point.

FICTIONARY -- The game of fantastic and farfetched definitions.  Each round 
one player chooses a word that none of the players knows.  You can choose 
your own word or pick one from the large selection included with the game.  
Then each other player makes up their own definition for the word.  Everyone 
votes for the word they think is the correct definition and points are 
scored for guessing the proper one, or misleading other players.  Special 
rules allow play by 2 or even 1 player.

The registered version of this program also includes a utility program that 
lets you customize the word list that comes with the game.  You can even 
create specialized lists for use as a vocabulary tester.

CAPBUF is a memory resident (TSR) program that lets you capture any text 
screen and save it for later processing or printing.  It is quite useful for 
programs that do not otherwise provide means of printing their results.  Use 
it for intermediate results of games, or collecting copies of messages while 
on a bulletin board.
